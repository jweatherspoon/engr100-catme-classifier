Comment,
I am very happy with my Team. We work very well together!,
I like all of my teammates. We are all good at different things which helps us to solve problems more quickly by bringing different skill sets to the table.,
Good team,
Andrew more often than not does not show up to the times we set to work on the hovercraft leaving Miguel and myself with all of the work. He tries to make up for it by doing a lot of the writing but sometimes he has the hovercraft making it impossible for anyone to do any work on it.,
"Great team, great guys.",
Good team that works very well together,
Things are going much better.,
The boys (Matthew and Nicholas) in my team have not been making the project a priority and it&#39;s frustrating for the rest of us (me and Sophia).,
"I feel like I&#39;m doing a majority of the work and just giving them small things to work on.  They don&#39;t take initiative and I always have to be the one that know what we have to do and how to do it.  I think this class would be much better suited for a 3rd or 4th year course, so people are less likely to drop out and are more motivated to do the assignments.  We had 2/5 group members drop the class, and my other 2 teammates are not the best.  The project itself is fun and I&#39;ve learned a lot of useful skills that will help me in the future, but it would be a lot better if we could have chosen our teams, so I could be in a group with more motivated people.",
"Neither of my teammates are too problematic or anything, however Ethan in particular is getting a bit... annoying. He does his work and he&#39;s contributed a ton to the project, however I&#39;m not very fond of him. I hate talking bad about my teammates but that&#39;s probably the one issue that I have with him in particular. Kristian is 100% ok. In fact, I like him a lot. But going back to Ethan. Today he blamed me for an issue that I had absolutely no control over and dumped all responsibility/blame onto me. He hasn&#39;t contributed anything outside of meeting times/labs (ex. ordering things, getting things from stores) other than holding the components. And the last thing I have to say is that he always asks me to do trivial tasks for him. There has not been one time this semester (I&#39;m not exaggerating) where he&#39;s rented out tools or asked for help himself. I&#39;ve had to ask for help/call over a TA every single time when he&#39;s the one who needs it every single time. &quot;Can you ask a TA for this-and-this.&quot; Every. Single. Time. Even when it&#39;s a tiny thing like asking for another stick of glue for the hot glue gun. He asked me to do it and I told him to get it himself (I was working on something else). He ended up just dropping the topic and waited for me to get it myself because we needed it to move on. I hope that this isn&#39;t openly stated as I don&#39;t want to ruin the team. In fact, if someone important is reading this, I beg of you to not openly go about this. I just thought I&#39;d share a few of my recent issues with him. Again, he&#39;s not problematic (as much as I made him seem like it), he just gets on my nerves. Perhaps I&#39;m talking a bit out of anger here due to the incident that happened today, but what I say is honest and I mean it.",
"When there is a slight problem my teammate Ethan Brown gets angry really fast, not particularly at us but with the problem itself. He has a short fuse, its really intimidating and it disturbs our thinking.",
Fantastic team!,
We are all getting along nicely!,
My team and I get along just fine and I don&#39;t feel that there are any problems between members.,
We all still seem to work together well and I am satisfied with the amount of work we are able to get done.,
I like all my teammatea and do not have anything bad to say about any of them.,
Nah fam,
Justin is especially helpful and does a great job at coordinating and leading the team.,
Hi :),
"One hiccup with team: Had problem turning in CO11 Report due to teammates not completing certain areas of it in time, was almost late.",
"It seems like Sean and I do a lot of the work sometimes. Everyone tries to get involved, but it never works out as Conor and Greg get distracted easily. When they have jobs to do they do them great when they&#39;re on time and decide to show up. Sean and I aren&#39;t perfect either, it just appears as we care more. I don&#39;t want to be harsh with them, I just want things to either change or be graded fairly as such.",
"Conor and Greg are very inconsistent about meeting times, as well as trying to changing times last minute.",
No comment.,
My teammates and I are building our hovercraft on time and as a team. ,
Everything is going well!! ,
Couldn&#39;t have asked for a better team :),
"Some team mates work much harder than others, but the teammates that do lots of work need to leave work for others.",
Very happy with my group and the way our project has turned out. However I believe that Skylar and Thomas have done an amazing job in particular ,
Scott is no longer part of the team as he has transferred to a different school,
"Our team-mate Scott may not be able to complete this semester unfortunately. Look to him for more details but he has told us he is moving within the week. We will do our best to complete the project with 3, It shouldn&#39;t be an issue as we are a good team and in a good spot. Scott has done a good bit of work for us and if it is true that he is leaving, he will be missed.",
"Scott is no longer in our group because he had to move to Texas. While he was here, he did everything he could to help the team out before he left.",
The only real issue is Chris coming late or leaving early on a regular basis. He agreed to the time we meet each day but seems to always have an excuse. Although he normally stays for at least an hour of our 2 hour meeting.,
"I sometimes feel like I&#39;m the only one with initiative, and that I&#39;m the only one who does things outside of regular meeting times. This makes it difficult for us to complete assignments on time because we can&#39;t accomplish everything at our meetings, and I&#39;m always stuck doing extra work.",
"Chris has made our team inefficient and tiresome. Every idea seems to become an argument instead of a discussion making the team members hate working and meeting for this project. However, we have been able and willing to push through these conflicts to create something great. ",
None.,
Things have dramatically improved since the last peer evaluation. Our team has no current issues.,
"(This seems more like a rant instead of actual constructive criticism, but I have no appropriate place to vent and this is the closest thing I can find.)
I am consistently bothered by how my group (and myself to some extent) will not work on anything ahead of time. I am part of the problem due to my poor communication skills, but since Jake has taken on the role of the &quot;voice&quot; of the team, the group will only work on things at the last minute. Jake, as the leading voice, is also not very respectful. I recall an instance where he ignored a valid excuse from a group member for being late on some work, instead telling him to just finish it. Again, this could have been avoided if we decided to work on projects ahead of time. I suppose that I should attempt to make a difference, but my passive personality, pessimistic outlook, and poor people skills make this difficult.
Apologies for name-calling, but I&#39;m quite angry at this point.",
We are getting the stuff we need to get done with reasonable communication and reduced stress.,
my group rox,
The members in my group work diligently and are very cooperative. Team 36 is a good team for completing work.,
"I find that the experience in working with groups is a necessary skill worth developing, but the overall attitude towards, school, projects, and any one of my teammates careers is not taken serious enough. I am not sure why this is the case, but I have already seen the lack of need for quality from the group members and do not know how to turn around this &quot;good enough&quot; attitude. It seems that has actually been the case for every group project while I&#39;ve been in college. I want to produce quality and that takes time, which other group members do not wish to spend. That would mean that I would do everything/almost everything to produce quality and might as well be doing the project alone which defeats the point of a group project. It is not because the time for the group project is not available, but more so of a &quot;get it over with&quot; kind of outlook. I disagree, but I am also outnumbered most of the time. If other group members agree, they do not voice their opinion on the matter which still leaves me stuck with a finished product that does not meet the standards I wanted set from the beginning. It is also frustrating to ask about the project when confused on certain aspects on how to complete certain stages, taking what I learn from asking a T.A. or professor, presenting it to the group on how to proceed, and then being contested by another group member that we go about it a different way. Ultimately, this has wasted a great deal of time that could have been spent on any other task closer to completing the project.",
none,
This is an amazing class and I have had so much fun participating in it. Thank you!,
John E. has only showed up to one of our meetings since the last team evaluation and he didn&#39;t do anything at that meeting. We text him and half the time he responds with &quot;Ok&quot; but doesn&#39;t show up and the other half of the time he doesn&#39;t even respond and doesn&#39;t show up.,
John still does not attend our team meetings.,
"John is not a teammate. He is late to meetings if he shows up. When he misses meetings he does not give a heads up or a why. We are 10 weeks into the semester and he has yet to pass his safety quiz meaning he can&#39;t be part of skills labs he is instead off doing his safety quiz. When he is at meeting he does not do work he is on his phone and listening to music. Shows no interest in what is being done. During skills labs he seems more interested in playing with the NXT as a toy rather than to try to program it. Is on his phone frequently but does not text the group chat often.
Other teammates Kyle, Carson, and Ryan are great. They show up at meetings on time and often early. Are participating in what we are doing and show interest in what&#39;s going on and give ideas how to better our hovercraft. Text back in the group chat. Have passed their safety quizzes and are able to do skills lab that require anything in the EDL. Are paying attention when at meetings and off phones unless using them for anything relating to the hovercraft.",
"John doesn&#39;t respond to texts and he doesn&#39;t do his fair share of work. When he does come to meetings, if he comes, then he won&#39;t do anything but he will just go on his phone and listen to music. He is often a terrible group mate who doesn&#39;t contribute his ideas at all. I sometimes wonder why he was put into our group, since we all have to complete a catme survey about our group mates and whether we want to work a lot of a little and other questions like that. John seems to be the farthest personality away from the rest of us, as he isn&#39;t focused and doesn&#39;t care. Everyone else in my group does their work diligently and always comes to the meetings that we have planned, where they show only their best work.",
Great job picking the teams.,
"Jessica has become a huge problem.  She does none of the work, drops what little responsibility she is asked to complete, and is defensive, vindictive, and downright mean when confronted.  Here are a few examples:
1. She doesn&#39;t do any of the work and then blames the rest of the team for &#39;hogging the project&#39; or &#39;not helping her out&#39; when in fact she never initiated the process for her to contribute.
2. When respectfully confronted about her lack of participation, she resorts to personal attacks, tears, finger-pointing, denial, etc.  (she has personally attacked me on several occasions trying to minimize me and the message I&#39;m trying to deliver)
3. Finally: apart from being disrespectful, vindictive, and lazy she poisons the team atmosphere whenever she&#39;s around.  She never has anything to add, she never takes the initiative to do something that would be useful: she&#39;s at best completely disengaged and unresponsive, at worst she is actively trying to tear the team apart.  She is such a drag on the team that I believe there would have been half the work AND personal stress if we had simply been a three-man team with me, jesus, and zach.  She does not deserve to ride our coattails and should be taken off the team or removed from the class, however I expect that there will be no action from you and she will pass this class with flying colors in spite of her unacceptable behavior.",
"Recently the team has had some conflicts. Gage and Jess had a confrontation regarding Jess missing the deadline for the CO11 Paper Assignment after being repeatedly reminded of the work and assuring us that she could complete and turn in our work on time. She failed and we missed all points due to her procrastination, while Gage was reprimanding her (somewhat harshly but I can understand seeing as he and I took the initiative to being and finish our assigned portions a week in advance) she could not accept the somewhat buy entirely unreasonable criticism and immediately retaliated against Gage in an immature and vindictive manor attacking Gage for not getting his degree and telling him that she wont take advice from him because of that. I immediately called both Gage and Jess seeing as the Group Chat was getting heated and did my best to defuse the altercation. The next confrontation was regarding the percentage of work done while we attended our meeting on Sunday 11/4 to work on Checkpoint 4 Gage felt that Jess did not due 25% of the work and she brought up how she never had the opportunity to do her portion of the assignment (Which is not unreasonable but she never took initiative to participate in the work, evident by her bored and somewhat annoyed attitude during our meeting. Multiple times I saw her and Zachery browsing their phones while Gage and I tried to address the objectives from the Checkpoint. She even tried to leave ahead of everyone else which disappointed me as she clearly feels that our time as a group is an annoyance). I hope that we can leave this behind us and move forward as a team that can be understanding and more forgiving of our members faults.",
Our only issue is that one of our members doesn&rsquo;t put in enough effort compared to everyone else. We haven&rsquo;t confronted him because we aren&rsquo;t sure how to do it properly.,
"I believe that being placed into a different team after the class had started had a negative impact on our performance as a whole. On the first day the teams interacted and set expectations. I was not there to contribute to this critical time period and I feel that my experience and our efficiency as a team may have been better had I been there from the beginning. I know with people dropping the class you have no choice, this is simply my observation.",
The team works really well together. We are able to solve a variety of problems and tasks without worrying about carrying too much individual weight or work per individual.,

"not everyone is always at meetings, we have everything finished  for cp4 though, i think that the rushing made people realize it is important",
"Awesome team no extra comments!
",
"We have had a couple of difficult meetings and some communication errors, but overall, we are making our deadlines, doing satisfactory work, and each team member is making a fair contribution. I don&#39;t think any one of us particularly stands out, but as long as the project is getting done, which it is, I don&#39;t have many complaints. The team on the whole is definitely starting to get a little fatigued by the project and the semester on the whole, resulting in reduced enthusiasm. I figure we need another successful checkpoint to give us another boost, and that should come soon. Therefore, I&#39;m satisfied enough, but not &#39;very&#39; satisfied.",
"We are a team of three. Me, Ben, and Juan. We are having no trouble without Derek and have already spoken with staff.",
Derek still hasn&rsquo;t come to any labs and has not coming to a single team meeting besides our very first one. He recently texted and contacted us but after the couple texts he sent he hasn&rsquo;t said a single thing to us again.,
"It would be much more beneficial to team efficiency if future classes will be able to pick teams and have teams that consist of students in other lab sessions. It will be more difficult for professors and TAs to keep track of grades, but it would offer students a chance to form teams with preexisting synergy.
All I&#39;m saying is that I would have liked to pick my own team.",
"Lately, my team members have been contributing more to the project but I still have to create the incentive to do things. Our meetings aren&#39;t started until I get there and I still feel tremendous pressure to lead the team. I have no problem being a leader, I just feel like I have to work extremely hard to my members involved until the ball is rolling and I can ease up a little bit.",
Our team is great and i love working with all of them. ,
Everyone is doing a great job meeting and building despite our varying schedules and different living situations. ,
they good,
"We all contribute; however, Stephanie does the least amount of work outside of meetings. Mikayla does her share but it still isn&#39;t as most as I do. I have been the only one to work on it outside of meeting hours and with my work schedule, it has become a lot more stress on me personally and I am trying my hardest to get this project done but it doesn&#39;t seem that they are as focused on it.",
Everyone works well.,

We&#39;re making it work.,
"Randal and Julia work very hard, sometimes too hard and get far ahead when they meet so that there is little work for many of us to do. But they are great teammates ",
"None of my teammates do anything except Randall. Whenever they decide to show up to meetings, which is rare, they put on the facade of doing work but never actually do anything. I do not know what to do about it. I have marked them off points in the team journal but that seems to have no affect on them. No one in my team has had previous experience with engineering so it is hard trying to figure out everything solely between Randall and I.",
:),
"My teammate Erick Bandala, is a good worker and does contribute a lot. Although he tends to have a bad attitude every once in a while. He takes it out on the group, but other times he is the opposite. Other than this, everything else is fine.",
"They&rsquo;re better than before and are becoming more engage in the assignments but there are just some problems. Ryan miss many of the meetings and one time he didnt come to the meetings in one week (revising Design report) when we clearly agreed that we have mandatory meetings on Monday and Wednesday. However, he contributed a lot in C011 report with the grammar and clarifying ideas. In Jordan&rsquo;s case, he&rsquo;s always late although he lives in a dorm which prevents us to work on our hovercraft as he keeps the hovercraft materials. On the other hand, Troy is always early and present but I feel like he doesn&rsquo;t read the materials for many of the checkpoint checklists that he always relies on me asking what he can do to help. In the end, im still acting as the leader with no courage to talk about these problems since i don&rsquo;t want to be awkward with the team if i do deduct them (as it will require all members to sign). Fortunately, there are improvements.",
"I think we&#39;re evolving as a group and good work is getting done, it&#39;s just that there&#39;s always a miscellaneous hiccup at each of the Checkpoints so far that messes with us.",
Good team ,
Great team!,
I love my team!,
"My team works very well together, and we plan to strive harder.",
"It seems that the other members work better under pressure. That being said, we will always work most on the hovercraft a day or so prior to the checkpoint. This is due to contrasting schedule of each members. Danyal starts work at noon; Rigo has a work and fraternity meetings and interviews in which makes him often absent or late in the meetings (if the team were stricter in attendance, he would have gotten deducted a lot); Mason and I don&rsquo;t have any extracurricular activities so we often start the meeting by ourselves. We decided not to be strict with the attendance because our schedules barely allows us to meet. Having a strict attendance policy would only make it more complicated and cause more conflict. Despite everything since the last evaluation, everyone worked better with the reports and checkpoints. But, I still believe that we could have done better with the team activities and they could respond to texts regarding meeting times quicker.",

We all really work well together and get along.,
I mostly expect more from myself but the we as a team accomplished a lot,

Team works very well together,
Ray Sandusky has been skipping and missing out on this project ever since he started his job. He hasn&#39;t been showing up and when he does he wants to leave early or has an excuse to leave early. He hasn&#39;t been contributing at all and isn&#39;t communicating especially when the team needs it. If we ask where is when he is missing during the meetings he says he was asleep and when he does respond he responds when the meeting is close to being over or when it is over.,
if i had to take this class again i would drop this class immediately. ,
"Ray is currently not doing much in terms of our hovercraft -or any engineering projects for that matter- but I believe he is too far behind to really catch up, so trying to bring him in to our project at this point would be more of a hindrance. The rest of the group is great. ",
It is going very good.,
Everything is going very well so far!,
Calvert has be a pretty good team member but his attitude has gotten pretty bad lately. ,
"While Max has started to pull more weight after his concussion is gone, Devin still does not do to much or respond in our group chat. ",

Andrew started showing up and contributing a lot to the project. ,
Everything is going great!,
"Some people in my group often do not do their job, making others have to step up and make up for it. Most work done in the group is not evenly shared throughout.",
"Morgan and I have to take control or else nothing gets complete. We have to make sure not only that the others did their work, but that they did it correctly. Oliver helps a good amount, but Morgan and I constantly find ourselves picking up what he slacks on or doesn&#39;t try on. Grace doesn&#39;t really do anything and rarely shows up to meetings. Whenever we count on her for something 80% of the time she doesn&#39;t deliver. I like all of my team members a lot, however, this project has just been extremely stressful for Morgan and I because we have to everything and worry about whether or not the others will do their part. We get low grades on almost everything due to this. I&#39;ve become friends with each of them which is why Morgan and I don&#39;t feel comfortable deducting them on the group point deduction forms. A possible suggestion is that for those point deduction forms to be submitted online individually because I know people in other groups are struggling with similar issues. Overall, however, I think this is an amazing class and I&#39;m really enjoying learning how to build this hovercraft.",
We&#39;ve been doing a really bad job in our checkpoints and I feel that we need to come early to get more points. Our group really needs to get extra points. I really recommend having more activities to gain more extra points.,
"We&#39;ve been really shitty at meeting up and doing quality work, but I know we can approve by being more assertive with one another and communicating better.",
"So far I am very satisfied with the performance of Martin Mata and Philip, they both contribute a lot to the team. as for Shiva and I, Shiva Plans very well but not often enough, so as a result spontaneous group meetings are made, often when i have not planned and i am in other classes or out of town. ",
"Teammates are eager to get the project done an complete assignments, all I can ask for. ",
tyler does nothing and without jace we&#39;d be lost,
I don&#39;t feel as if the best way to do subtracting points to ensure full team work is the way of the subtraction sheets.  It is something that sometimes our group ends up doing together and if I am the one person to say &quot;hey these people should get minus points that&#39;s a very uncomfortable conversation especially in an environment that they don&#39;t see as professional and me bringing that up with further reduce the teamwork that we have.  I am not really sure what solution there could be as they will always see their grade but I do know that with my group members not showing up often and when they do contributing little I definitely have been getting much more out of the class.,
excellent team i have. we all work together well and are an excellent match for one another.,
"My teammates are spectaular. However, once again I believe I am doing significantly LESS work than them. My 300 and 400 level engineering classes prevents me from going to all the meetings and spending quality time on the project.",
Nothing new to add to previous comments. Situation is still the same. ,

We all procrastinate and we are always down to the wire but we all always bend over backwards to get it done. I wish my team wasn&#39;t as big of a procrastinator as me but I also am happy with my team.,
"Very displeased with my group.
Roman has stepped up his participation with the group and has made a great effort contributing to the team since last time. Sebastian is doing a good job. Jelliam has done a great job except she did not contribute to the CO11 report at all. She claimed that she was having family issues directly after the report was due. Not sure if that is true or not but wish she would have started earlier or let us know beforehand.
Katie (Katherine) is the least helpful of the group. She does not respond to messages in a timely manner (does not respond to messages within 24 hours), started the CO11 project 40 minutes before it was due and I had to turn it in uncompleted. She was unable to make our last meeting because of mandatory babysitting but said she would start on the CO11 project in which she did not.
I feel pressured to construct the hovercraft myself because of my teams unreliability and lack of engineering sense but I do leave a good amount for the rest of my team to contribute to the hovercraft. All that I ask is for my team to show enthusiasm to and interest in the project.
Unfortunately my team is not very tech savvy nor has much engineering sense which is to be expected. Some of my teammates do try and put effort into the project during meeting which I appreciate.
If you have any questions or need clarification, please contact me at cameron@CCCreno.com.
Kind Regards",
"Roman and Katie will sometimes ignore the group chats when we have important stuff to discuss, and me and Cameron are left to work. Jellium has a job, so she is excused when she tells us she&#39;s working.",
"Roman has improved some on his contribution to the team but still seems to barely do his fair share. I have been a little distant lately because there has been a medical emergency at home so I got home on weekends to take care of my family, but I&#39;m doing what I can to pull my weight while I&#39;m here.",

Great teamwork,

"We still have issues with communication and such as a whole. The work always gets done but it takes a lot of effort since we still sorta don&#39;t have a fifth member. Fernando has now done some work before with reports and such but he still will not be audible to us in most instances. Max is bad with time management. He does try to make up for it but it ultimately leads to being really close to deadlines. Jesse, Adrian and I are as invested in it as we can be with these struggles. I worry that the harder the checkpoints and the further along we go, the less we will achieve.",
"i believe that our team should try to finish checkpoints early rather than turning them in at the last second. There were no wheels left at the EDL so we had to check other stores to see if they had Lego sets that had wheels. I believe that we can make it. However, I&#39;m still worried about not finishing in time.",
..,
"We are starting to work out some of the schedule conflicts we had before, and are currently doing well in coming together and getting work done both evenly and fairly among the team, typically through voluntary efforts from all members to take on specific tasks or parts of tasks, or coming together to work on one task as a whole.",

We all work well together but we can only meet in the mornings so it is sometimes difficult for everyone to wake up on time. ,
Thanks for putting me with such a great team!!,
I joined this group late after my first team of three split up. I really enjoy all of my partners and feel we get work down in a fun environment.,
"I enjoy the team I am on. We all work together very well and have different strengths and skills that complement one another&#39;s. Because everyone on our team is talented and responsible, we are able to spread the work out evenly and therefore make the workload on the group as a whole easier.",
"Great guys, great team.",
AT this moment the team seems to be heading in a positive direction. The team dynamic is still a bit rough but is smoothing out at this point.,
"For the first assignment that we had to turn in as a group, I had to do all of the work myself. I&#39;ve talked to them about it since then, and things seem to be improving thankfully. ",
"It is very difficult to find meeting times that are convenient for the entire team. Especially because Ryan lives off campus and doesn&#39;t drive, then Oscar recently got a new job that takes up a lot of hours throughout the week and weekends. ",
We have not met Bo Fu,
We work well together and most of the time all show up on time.,
"I texted them all throughout the weekend (including Friday) and there was not a reply until Sunday night at 6pm from one teammate. I ended up doing all the calculations and planned everything else out and had to adjust all of the work that was done prior because everything was wrong. I couldn&#39;t spend the whole night because I have to be up at 5am for ROTC and I cannot be dealing with the whole checkpoint, or ever the whole project, the night before it is due.",
My only complaint is the lack of communication within the group. It&#39;s very stressful when they don&#39;t respond to your texts right away with a deadline coming up. ,
"I feel like I&#39;m doing most of the work in the group.  Ben and Andrew both dropped the class, but Philip and Kristian are somewhat helpful.  For checkpoint 1 I did a large majority of the work.  I did all the calculations, the paragraph for propulsion, and did all the calculations for and selected the batteries.  Philip and Kristian were there while I was doing it, but they didn&#39;t offer much help even when I asked for it.  Philip picked out the fans from the EDL which was helpful and Kristian picked out the deck and had a calculator to help with the calculations, but beyond that they didn&#39;t do that much.  They weren&#39;t very clear on the requirements and I basically had to tell them to do things or they wouldn&#39;t do it.  They aren&#39;t bad teammates, but I wish they would take more initiative in getting the work done.",
"There is a person in our team that we haven&#39;t even met and there was one that is transferring out. But even it is just the three of us, I believe that we are a strong team.",
I am not dissatisfied with my team; we are all respectful of each other and complete our work. I just feel that we have not been able to reach that higher level of interacting as a great team--we&#39;re just an average team right now.,
Sometimes I feel as though my concerns are brushed off instead of addressed. ,
I have never taken an engineering course before and chose to explore engineering this semester through this class. I like the pace the lectures are set at but I feel that I often get left behind during team discussions. I have repeatedly said that I am new to this but I feel that my team expects me to be on their level. They have all taken engineering classes in high school and this is review to them. I want to be able to contribute equally but I am not sure how to do so when my teammates are so far ahead of me,
"I have really strong teammates, particularly Joseph and Mark, who have experience in the activities we are learning, and I am very grateful for them. Personally, everything we are learning are very new to me so sometimes I feel lost. My teammates are very awesome in helping me understand the content, but sometimes I feel bad in the sense that I can&#39;t fully contribute as much as them solely because I don&#39;t have the same level of experience to know how to help more effectively. Overall, I am very satisfied with my group and I am beyond grateful to have them guide me through all of this.     ",
Great group!,
We do good work and we have no problems :),
Overall great team! We are all very social and friendly!,
"We all put an equal amount of work into the project. Some of us are busier than others so some of us aren&#39;t at the group meeting for the whole duration of the group meetings but I ot really bothered by it because like I said, we all put in an equal amount work into the hovercraft.",
"For the most part our group is good. Chad hasn&#39;t showed up to the last couple meetings we&#39;ve had and blames it on his frat plans. Also, when he does show up, he&#39;s on his phone a lot, but he will contribute to the group every once in a while.",
I generally prefer to work on my own rather than in a team. I am satisfied with my teammates but would rather rely on myself and not others.,
hi :),
"Our team is meshing well, work is getting done in time, ideas are being communicated clearly. ",
"At first Sean and I seemed to be trying to complete the first checkpoint by ourselves for the first meeting we had, but once we decided to change the days our team meets then we all contributed fully and we now work together to the best of our abilities. ",
"We did not start on the best of terms, but things have slowly been improving.",
Nothing to complain about. Everything is running smoothly. ,
"N/a
",
I am just very happy with the team that I have. We all communicated with each other well and Dylan is very smart and helpful. I just feel so lucky.,
Everything is going great,
I am very satisfied with my team and have no complaints.,
My team is productive and interactive. We will have a good time contracting a hovercraft together. ,
There wonderful honestly ,
Loving it so far!,
"No issues, they&#39;re all great at collaborating, willing to help, and kind to one another.",
Things have been running pretty smoothly! No big issues so far.,
"Some team mates do way more work that others, it is easy to tell who knows what they are doing and who does not. All team members do what they are asked of generally, so I have no serious complaints. ",
All of my teammates are very capable. I do find the presence of Daniel a bit grating as hes quick disrespectful at times though i know it is not intentional and meant to be that of levity.,
Good team!,
Everyone is working well together and always asking questions.,
"A lot of the issues so far have been showing up to the meeting on time, it has been discussed and hopefully the future meetings are better. The discussion has been good but outside of the discussion only two members have done any work; Ryan the most and Aspen (me) the next most. I think the issues now will work themselves out now that we have a task list and discussed being on time.",
"Warren has not showed any interest in participating in the group projects or being prepared for class. He is excited to be apart of the team however is very distracted when all are working. The only big team player in this group from my point of view is Kolton. Him and are the only ones striving to get a working hovercraft. This is very frustrating when the entire teams knows that him and I are working outside of going to school. If our team was stronger and more focused, we could be submitting better work.",
"I think our team is doing well together so far and we are starting to warm up to eachother more. I am excited to complete the rest of the hovercraft project with my team.
",
"My team&#39;s not too bad, but I wish there was someone with more initiative, because I feel like they just dont care enough, only enough to pass and no more.",
"Jonvis: Great
Justin: Good
Preet: Should come around when programming because he said he knows it very well. ",
"William and Mason are the glue that hold this team together.
",
"I am very impressed with the way my team has come together through adversity, we have become one unstoppable unit on our way to building the best hovercraft the university has ever seen",
I am happy with my team and I am learning a lot about working with other engineers in a respectful manner. ,
"Group is fine, no need for anything
",
Team is great so far,
N/A,
"The only person who I feel doesnt fit with the team is myself. Otherwise, everything is well and accounted for",
"The workload is not divided up very fairly; I feel like Emily and I are the main contributors to each major assignment. However, every member does contribute in some way so it has not been a big issue.",
I enjoy the group that I was put into and also enjoy the diversity within the group. We are starting to build a bond with each other and also building friendships. I am happy to be working with these people and hopefully our friendships can carry over to the future.,
John hasn&#39;t done any work and hasn&#39;t contributed to the team at all. He doesn&#39;t show up to the meetings until we ask where he is and he&#39;s usually 20-30 minutes late. During the meetings he sits on his phone the whole time.,
"Jon doesn&#39;t contribute anything to the group, he&#39;s already missed multiple team meetings and the ones he does come to, he often arrives late and leaves early. He doesn&#39;t do any work while he&#39;s with our group and he just stays on his phone until he gets bored and leaves.",
John Ethiarianmwian does not show up to team meeting on time. Does not talk to teammates about what is needed to be done. Is late without excuse for why he is late when it was agreed upon the time where we would meet. Then leaves after 30 minutes without doing any work. ,
John doesn&rsquo;t do as much as others in our group.,
This isn&#39;t my team soooooooooooooooooooooooooo,
"I would like to say that you guys did a great job picking teams, because I think mine is fantastic.",
I am very happy to be a part of this team. We all work together very well and I believe we are going to have a very successful hovercraft! ,
I noticed that CATme still thinks that Ian and Kevin are on our team. They were never in the class with us.,
"Hey, it seems CATME has me in the wrong team. I&#39;ve been in Team 41 the whole semester, been working with them and meeting with them. I have not once been a part of team 42. I gave perfect reviews just because I&#39;m not going to mess with the scores of a team I&#39;ve never met.",
"Ian and Kevin are not in our group. Group number 42 is Jonathan, Henry, Aj, and Hector. ",
"I would say my team suffers more from a lack of drive than anything else.  Jesus is a great partner, like me, proactive, punctual, does good work ahead of deadlines, etc.  However zach and especially Jess seem to be very apathetic to the project as a whole.  They&#39;re last to respond to group messages, last to volunteer for work on the project.  It seems to me that Jess and Zach&#39;s ideal scenario would be to sit back and do no work while me and Jesus complete the project for them.
This isn&#39;t so much of a problem for me because I have dealt with these situations in the past.  I am very open, honest and clear about how Jess and Zach behave and how it&#39;s unacceptable, but Jesus is a bit of a pushover and would let them continue to take advantage of his good nature.  We will be successful as a team, and complete the project, I just with I had more than one team member that was interested in doing actual work on the hovercraft.  ",
No notable concerns or issues.,
"We have a hard time finding a schedule to meet altogether to work on assignments, the meeting times change all the time and makes it hard to complete assignments as a team.",
Having a great time!,
"Kacey is absent due to work a lot, has a somewhat abrasive personality. I have no idea who our extra team-mate is. I know Ariana, Tyler, Parker, and Kacey",
I do not appreciate Kacey Wilson and the way he has been involved with this team. He says he will finish his part or turn things in and he is not always 100% reliable. He has missed a couple lectures and one meeting and always makes excuses for why. ,
No comments,
"I am happy to be working with my team. I feel as though I am doing my fair share of work, but do not feel burdened with a more than fair amount.",
My team is great.,
I like my team so there isn&rsquo;t much to say,
The group is great.,
ham can,
I currently have no concerns with my team.,
"Catme did a shitty job putting compatible times, but the group works very well together with no complaints. ",
"Very surprised as to how well we are working together as a team. No complaints.
",
"Overall, I am satisfied with the way my team has worked together. I have taken on a leadership role in the team rather naturally, without sitting down and deliberating on it. I took initiative in organizing assignments and my teammates followed, which has worked out well so far. Naturally this means I end up with extra responsibility, especially for quality check on our team assignments and ensuring accuracy of teammates contributions. I have generally been pleased with how graciously my teammates have received assignments that I delegate, and they have generally done fairly well on those tasks. However, I have spent more time than I would like critiquing my teammates&#39; written portions of group work. This is the only area where I am dissatisfied with the work of my teammates. I spent a great deal of time editing and re-writing portions of the design concept report because of this. Beyond this, they are a great team with good ideas, who hold civil deliberations about those ideas, and share the work well. I am sure we will continue to work well together as a team, and hopefully we grow strong enough to truly excel.",
Daniel Garcia is no longer on this team but was included in the survey ,
Derek never goes to meetings or replys to texts. ,
"I answered strongly agree, agree, and agree for working with my teammates, Juan and Ben, who contribute and communicate. I do not feel the same for Dereck, as you can see how I evaluated him in the previous ratings.",
"Derek has barely shown up to any lectures or labs since we&rsquo;ve been put into groups, has hardly shown up to any of our meetings, and never communicates with us outside of class. My other teammates and I are having to do the work of 4 people between the 3 of us and it&rsquo;s putting an immense amount of stress on us and is not helping us. I&rsquo;m fairly certain he has missed more classes then he&rsquo;s shown up too and it&rsquo;s most decidedly not ok with me, or my other teammates.",
My team works well with each other and it makes the group meeting very productive! ,
My team is great to work with,
"They&#39;re all great, except I have no idea who tashin is",
Pretty good teamwork and everyone is respectful of each other. Nothing bad to comment on,
Daniel could keep his opinions to himself. When it comes to brainstorming Daniel only contributes when he thinks he is right and almost every time he is proven wrong.,
"I am usually the only productive one during meetings. Brennan Peterman has been slightly helpful with the workload and communicating good, plausible ideas. But other members often mess around during meetings and I am often left to the checkpoints and assignments by myself. I don&#39;t think I can continue on this trend for the rest of the semester as I am already really overwhelmed.",
I am very happy with my team and how we all have the same mindset to make the best hovercraft.,
Team 57 is the best!!!,
Our team works extremely well together and we have a great chemistry already. I could not be happier with my team. ,
Everyone in my group is working well together with minimal issues concerning timing of meetings.,
Not much to say other than the fact that I like my team. We get along pretty good and we are all willing to do work. Sometimes we joke around as well. All in all I am quite satisfied. Hopefully they all feel the same. ,
"they are very good
",
Everyone does their work and works very well together.,
Tyler is no longer in our group.,
We are meeting and getting all the work we set out done. I am pleased with how well we work together.,
We&#39;ve been getting along great and have worked well together.,
Nothing comment other than glad i am on the team that I am on.,
"Great teammates, Can&#39;t complain, all productive and all willing to sacrifice their time to archive the goal.",
I very much like my team. I would not be able to contribute as much if it were not for them. They have helped me better understand the concepts in class. I know I put in my fair share of work but it never feels like I&#39;m doing enough.,
We struggle to communicate as a group,
"I said I agree that I like working with my team, but it was kind of frustrating last week when they all thought it would work better to communicate over text message to put together checkpoint 1 instead of actually meeting in the edl for just an hour to talk about what batteries to buy, how many fans, etc. Kristina ended up doing pretty much all of checkpoint 1, which I appreciate because I know she is really busy and I admire that she took initiative and got it done, but I would have liked to do it together as a team. I think doing that would have made the assignment better (someone could have noticed the few math mistakes she made) and made us a better team. Also I don&#39;t love that they all talk during lecture, I just think that&#39;s pretty disrespectful. I hope this actually is confidential, I don&#39;t want to be mean. ",
"We all work together well, but Alison is very quiet, she&rsquo;s always listening and paying attention but she rarely ever speaks up, we&rsquo;ve all tried to get her to participate more, and be an active part of the group but she prefers to stay on the side just listening. We did find that she is more likely to speak up through our group text message.",
no comment,
This is a good team.,
"Good team, Me and Alexis take leadership roles",
Awesome team. Thank you ,
My team is great!,
"I feel we all get along well, its a good experience. ",
I am pleased to be in such a creative group. Our diverse backgrounds of interest have helped us to better evaluate ideas and execute them.,
"Despite the lack of diversity in our team, as we are all Caucasian males, we work rather well together and feed off of each other&rsquo;s ideas and energy. ",
We make it work thats what this class is all about right?,
I have done all the work myself along with my partners Leo and Randall.,
"I feel like I am the one who moves the team around, and I am okay with that but the only thing I am worried about is that I might end up paying all of the costs for the hovercraft and I really don&#39;t think that is fair. I hope there is a way in which if my teammates don&#39;t pay their part of the costs, they lose points. But, overall, my team has been good so far. They are all enthusiastic and they bring a lot of ideas that I would have never thought of on my own.",
"I really like my team, we get along well and work together extremely well.",
"Johnny Lei&rsquo;s contribution has been minimal, but only because the first week of meetings were chaotic and a bit unorganized, and he didn&rsquo;t make the effort to stay on top of it. However, now that we&rsquo;ve settled down, Johnny has led us to believe that he will start contributing more, and we expect this to be true. ",
"On the first survey that i took regarding leadership, I responded that I would be a follower that may lead the team if necessary, however, since our group didn&rsquo;t establish a leader yet, no one&rsquo;s initiating a discussion to do the group work but me. It seems like there&rsquo;s a hidden rule to not talk about work load unless we&rsquo;re in a meeting or during the lecture. To compensate this hidden rule, i message them and ask what our plans are and suggest some methods we could take. For example, i sketch a propulsion idea and asked them for any feedbacks but only got one reply that praises the design (without any feedbacks until we met). Another problem is the team&rsquo;s availability. According to the catme survey, everyone should be available at some hours during weekdays and during weekend mornings. But, Ryan has work and some more emergencies than anticipated so meetings will have three members at most often. Ryan has the most absences on meetings as we meet on Wednesday noon and Thursday afternoon. During these time period, he has work or class so it&rsquo;s very hard to give information (which then results to confusion). Jordan however, works and participate a lot during meetings. But because he uses google drive to save documents, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to work in a new app that also requires saving the documents frequently (as to what I&rsquo;ve seen). Troy on the other hand is quiet but a hardworker who asks questions a lot. However, there are also times that i wonder if Troy or the others read the instructions as they will come to me and ask about how to do things that are specifically discussed on the directions. Overall, they are great members when they start working and do a great job. ",
"\We all got off to a pretty rough start with Checkpoint 1 but we&#39;ve grown, developed, and matured to be a better team.",
Thus far I have felt a little discouraged by my group&#39;s communication efforts. I believe that my team will begin to improve our cohesiveness going forward thanks to intervention efforts by Prof. Doyle. ,
Good team but need better communications,
I couldn&#39;t have picked a better team myself.,
I have amazing teamates!!!,
Hi my Name is Rigoberto Cardenas and im grateful for the teammates I have.,
"In the first survey, I remember filling up the choice that says something about not being a leader but would initiate if needed; however, I, in every single assignment, initiated everything. If I hadn&rsquo;t contacted my team, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a binder and have our team schedule printed out for the binder check. For the checkpoint 1, I stayed hours to properly set the equations right alone because there seems to be a rule that we only work on stuff when we have a meeting. About the meeting, we don&rsquo;t even have proper meeting times because most of them are working (I quit my job to focus to have more time to do homeworks but it just made it harder for me because I almost do all the work). I even talked to professor Vollstedt that our schedule doesn&rsquo;t really match the one in CATME anymore so I created a doodle survey just to see when everyone&rsquo;s available. It helped but there&rsquo;s only three people at most who can meet; so I told them that we could still have a meeting and have the person absent informed later.
Whenever we meet, Mason just keeps complaining how he is hungry and wants to go home. When we were picking the fans for our hovercraft, I have to teach him how the inH20 value we calculated works in the flow chart. Despite all that, he still asked a front desk person to show him.
He also never told that he couldn&rsquo;t attend the meeting time so I deducted him (without telling him which I regretted). This was forgiven in the condition that he would initiate the design report, he didn&rsquo;t and told us he didn&rsquo;t have the calculations or the checkpoint document which he could text us for&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t share the word document because most haven&rsquo;t set up their office accounts and emails. I sent them links to how to set them up. We used most of our meeting hours in the design report draft. Fortunately, Danyal have the template ready.
About Danyal, he barely talks and when asked it usually goes with &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. In the end of our meeting about the design report, we decided to give people sections to polish in our report, he didn&rsquo;t do it. I told the team, I wouldn&rsquo;t deduct him (like Mason) in the condition he would initiate the next checkpoint.
Rigoberto is a bit more concerned with the class. He would ask questions about what he doesn&rsquo;t understand; however, he may ask a lot of them. In the references section he was supposed to work on, he just asked how to do it. I told him to think of it as citing a works cited list and check the handbook in the canvas, and he came back without anything for the meeting saying he still doesn&rsquo;t  know how to do it.
And while waiting for a professor to check our propulsion system, I remember them talking about just wanting to get an A in the class...(yet their actions shows otherwise).",
Not applicable,
We get it done and I&#39;m excited to see the results we produce and to be able to contribute,
n/a,
Group 77 is a great team and we work very well together.,
One thing that is an annoyance but not terrible is that some of the members are late to the team meetings. However they do show up which isn&#39;t a total loss but it is annoying on waiting to get started.,
Everything has been good so far except for some minor communication problems. ,
"So far the team has been working well, and I don&#39;t see any future problems arising. ",
"Overall, my team works well together and everyone contributes to the project in their own way.",
My team works good together.  Schedules make it hard to meet for long periods of time but everyone is dedicated so we make it work.,
"Honestly, my group has only had 3 members show up consistently which makes our total work load somewhat unbalanced.",
I love working with the team I have. They are all hard workers and there has been no bad apple behavior!,
I enjoy working with my team!,

I have no quarrel with my teammates but I do recommend that some sort of ability to request teammates or suggest people in your class you would work well with is implemented. I believe it would be very beneficial to be able to recommend people that you know you work with well. I am not suggesting that we pick our teams i am just suggesting that you implement the ability for the team creating software to consider requests from students.,
The team has a lot of interesting prospective.,
"Jordan Lee is switched out of ENGR 100, so he has not been here since the 1st class",
Great Team!,
"Can you remove David from the CatME? He dropped this class on the second week. Thank you!
Other than that, good team, no complaints.",
Please take David out of the survey he is not in the college of Engineering anymore.,
"David is no longer part of this team because he dropped the class, but my other two partners are great. We get a lot of work done when we are working and we always try to accommodate for each other. Everyone contributes ideas and none of us disrespect each other. We all meet on time and try to distribute the work evenly. Michael does great work on the computer because he has shown exceptional knowledge in that area. Kevin also does great work. He is organized and does a lot of the calculations and we all help each other out when we make a mistake",
Team 93 = Best Team,
"My team members are helpful, we all have been meeting regularly and have good experiences with  working together. Should be a good rest of the semester.",
Everyone In my team work well and have no problems. ,
"Team of 3 : Nathan Gay, Jakob Delossantos, Paul Honein. The fourth member, Matthew Gover never showed up to class or lab. Our current teammates work well together and contribute evenly. I like to be organized so I organize our meet ups and split parts of assignments between the three of us. I also like to read over all of our work and make sure that it is correct and of high quality. I also try to inform my team through text messages of what we will be doing at meetings, and what is due for ENGR 100.",
"Mathew is not on our team so i just gave him the lowest rating in all. I enjoy having a team of three. All in all our team meetings have been greatly productive except Paul hasn&#39;t been able to show up sometimes for various reason, but we excuse him because the reasons are valid and he does his fair share of the work when we are together. Other than that Jake has taken the lead in knowing what to do which is great, I keep the parts and we work together well.",
"this team is pretty good, I enjoy working with my team, I think we&#39;ll get it done. the only thing is that Patrick apparently usually has something going on and sometimes shows up late to the meeting/ class or not at all. it&#39;s a tiny bit frustrating but we deal with it.",
I am happy with my team.,
"I think I have a pretty solid team on my hands. They are involved and we haven&rsquo;t had any butting of heads thus far. Only issues are trying to coordinate times and communication via text, but those challenges come with groups I suppose.",
Nothing things are working fine,
The entire team works really well together,
"Up to this point, I have done most the work. Moving forward I&rsquo;m gonna try to take a more leadership oriented role and try have team members directly assigned projects. The team&rsquo;s initial relaxed strategy failed to yield results and I ended up having to pick up nearly all the slack leading up to Checkpoint 1",
"I feel as though our team has had a rocky start. I think that we have the potential to be a good team and I like my teammates as people, but I am sometimes disappointed with their contributions to the team and feel that there needs to be improvement.",
no Comment.,
We all get along and work together very well and effectivly. Every problem we&#39;ve run into has been very easy to resolve or overcome in the Hovercraft Design process.,
"Gabrielle, Antonio, and I work very well together and show up for all team meetings, labs, and lectures. Andrew has only shown up to lecture and one lab session and he has not shown up for any team meetings or contributed at all in our hovercraft project.",
"Andrew just has not showed up to anything (has not attended any labs or team meet ups). He just shows up to lecture, but he is always late. Apart from him my team is great.",
"I am fine with my group at the moment, but there are times where getting a lot of work done is not the easiest. Overall its a good group and if we are actually working, we can get some good work done as a team.",
My team is working well together and have had no arguments or close calls with work not being done on time.,
"Every time we meet we get at least our goals done, and we set new goals each meeting, and plan on what to do. I am very satisfied with my team",
"Nothing, my teammates are really good and we share interesting ideas that help further the projects.",
"We ight, just need to communicate more and work on meeting more and communicating when we are not available better",
I see a lot of potential in my engineering group and I hope to see them succeed now and In the future.,
I feel that the group is very good and we have yet to hit a any hurdles that would make me prove otherwise. Everyone&#39;s doing a great job and I&#39;m glad that everyone s pulling their weight. ,
"For most part i do not have anything against my teammates. We do however need to work on communicating, meeting deadlines and working as a four person group not 2-3.",
I have no other comments i believe my team works very well together,
Josh signed off on the hours of meeting but can&rsquo;t actually meet during our biggest section. Along with that josh was supposed to complete a section on the paper and completely didn&rsquo;t do it and told us 7 minutes before it was due.  Leaving me to complete it in terrible fashion and most likely getting a terrible score on it.,
I enjoy my teammates and working with them.,
My team and i work well. i am very satisfied with them.,
"My group is working great. However due to my class schedule and amount of 300 and 400 level classes I am currently taking I do not have the time to work with my teammates as much as they would like me to.
I believe I am the weakest link on our team due to other classes I am taking",
"While our team is good about getting work done on time and in a timely manor, we are not the best about showing up for meetings or communicating outside of our time together. ",
No complaints,
"Good group of guys. When given a task they complete it, usually quickly. I need to assert more of a direct command or things don&rsquo;t seem to get done. I also procrastinate as much as anyone else. We are working fixing that as a team. Overall we are okay and work well together. No major concerns or complaints, yet. ",
Our team works very well together and we do just fine. ,
Overall my team is working well and we all get along. There are no issues. ,
Great team. I love working with them.,
Team works completely fine and no distinct issues in between. ,
Its all good but would be nice if there were more diversity ,
No comments. ,
Good Team!,
"Dalton Craig, I believe dropped out. I just gave him a good review for the time he was here. ",
I&#39;m pretty sure Flores dropped out and she won&#39;t even respond to our messages. Also haven&#39;t seen her in like 2 weeks.,
My team is great,
It&rsquo;s all going pretty good.,
We work well together and we always get everything done.,
"Jilliam and Sebastian are good teammates and participate. Roman is decent but wasn&#39;t too helpful during the design report project. I assigned him to do page 6 of the report and didn&#39;t start it until 1 hour before it was due and told me he didn&#39;t know how to do it so I had to do page 6 as well (I did page 1 and 2). Katherine (Katie) rarely responds to group chat messages, complains a lot, shows lack of interest, and didn&#39;t contribute to the design report project.",
leek and one other have dropped.,
Not a lot of ambition in this group... ,
Team works well together the catme system just didnt pair us together very well cause there was not very much tome based on the surveys that we could meet but the team made it work,
None at this time,
we&#39;re cool,
Team is great,
No issues,
I enjoy working with my team and I believe that we work well together.,
"n/a
y&#39;all great",
I personally don&#39;t understand the point of these surveys but whatever. In regards to class I feel as if the focus of these lectures are to indoctrinate us with the &quot;proper&quot; way of thought. I highly disagree with many statements iterated within the lectures but will put up with them none the less.,
I am really enjoying this project and the team I was assigned ,
we rock,
My team is great.,
This has been one of the most efficient groups that I have been involved with regarding school projects. Everyone brings something special to the table and we all make it work very well. ,
"With the vast academic backgrounds that my team has, we have all been adhere to each others&rsquo; strengths as well as improving each others&rsquo; weaknesses.",
"Overall I have great trust and expectations for our group. We all appear to be motivated, intellectual, and focused on achieving our goals. Communication is outstanding as well. Very happy with design team. ",
My team is the best!,
"The communication skills and knowledge of my team is satisfactory and I have confidence that we will successfully build a hovercraft, and the workload is divided evenly amongst the team and I.",
"I&#39;m pleased with my team, we work well together. Everyone answers their phones.",
I think I was paired with perfect teammates. I think we can work together completely fine on this project.,
"Our group overall, we are very involved with the project. Each member contributed to our design. ",
"Everyone in my team is hardworking, and contributes equally. No complaints. A good team.",
My team is great and we all work well together.,
What can I say except you&#39;re welcome.,
No comment,
"I really like my team. We work well together, and I&#39;m excited for what&#39;s to come.",
Everything is good so far,
I&#39;m feeling good about this project overall.,
Our team feels very complete and diverse in personality range without compromising quality of work. ,
I feel like we have a pretty good team and we all work well together. We also communicate things that we need and split up the work well. ,
"Sometimes when I ask them if they can make changes to our work, no one replies and I&rsquo;m stuck making the changes. Although they do contribute, it&rsquo;s frustrating when they don&rsquo;t answer until hours later. ",
There is little if anything to say about my team that is negative and we all seem to work together really well. We never have conflicts that are serious and always can work together to overcome problems that arise.,
"Zach Orr has been especially helpful and hardworking during this project. As a team we work together very well and all contribute time, effort and ideas.",
"Everyone in the group puts forth their best effort to complete the assignments and tasks that we are challenged with.
",
"so far our group is very good, we do sometimes struggle with the worksheets and other things but we do grind through it and finish things on time",
"While there are times whe the group has dfficulties, it is easily fixed onve we get it out. after that we all coe together and insure the work is completed.",
Good team.,
Teammates are great. CATME was a success.,
I like the team I am on and think we work well together.,
"My team is lowkey the G.O.A.T., call us the &#39;07 Patriots",
Great group and get along very well with each other. ,
Team works well together. Meets deadlines.,
"My team works well together. Whenever we get stuck or need help, one of us is always there to try and help. ",
We have a good team and everyone has an input as to what the hovercraft plans are and work is distributed evenly and everyone carries their weight equally.,
We have a difficult time meeting with one another due to the difference in our schedules,
No comments.,
I only have an issue with Fernando. I believe our only issue is that he is the one teammate that is not willing to discuss or talk at all. The team is starting to gain the traits as described in the week reading quiz talking about the types of teammates. I don&#39;t want to deduct points because I don&#39;t know if he is extremely socially awkward and/or has some issue that is damaging his performance. Everyone on the team is suffering over time because of him. I&#39;m hoping he will open up over time so we can become more productive.,
"In all honesty it seems as if Jacob, Jesse, and I are doing most of the work. Although Fernando shows up to the group meetings, he does not talk to us or help with work. He may just be too shy, we try to get him to talk. Max will either be late to our meetings and classes. He helps with work only when we tell him to do it. But he has missed many engineering classes which leads him to asking us very basic questions about the hovercraft he should have already known.",
na,
"My teammates are perfectly fine, though this survery was a rather innacurate assessment of that, because in some cases some of us are above where I put us in the team and in some cases some of us are below where I put us in the team. It also doesn&#39;t take into account workload except in the center box. This becomes an issue because Daylen does the most work in the group, I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all agree on that, but he also doesn&#39;t request feedback and doesn&#39;t always inform the group of what he&#39;s doing until he&#39;s doing and/or done it. In these cases it hasn&#39;t turned out poorly and hasn&#39;t harmed us, normally it benefits us, but were I to answer it in the chart we were given I&#39;d have to place him lower than he truly belongs because one of the lower answers describes that act. I also did only some things in the top, we all did only some things in the top, I asked for feedback constantly and made sure what I was doing was ok and I worked on communicating, but I don&#39;t believe I provide any special inspiration to the team. Keara does much the same, Daylen doesn&#39;t ask for feedback much but probably provides the most inspiration based solely on the example he sets of working effectively.",
The only team member we have a problem with is Fergus. ,
I honestly am not 100% sure on fearhgus he showed like 4 weeks in and he is constantly unsure about everything and slows down productivity and isnt 100% reliable for work.,
"Our team (156) doesn&#39;t have a ton of communication between each other. Yinkai is usually late to class or doesn&#39;t show up, and although he is very smart and probably knows what he is doing, he doesn&#39;t contribute much at all, and it seems like David, Khoa, and myself end up doing a lot of work. I&#39;ve personally spent quite a bit of time working on the project, and I don&#39;t mind it very much, I just think it is good to work together as a group and get everyone&#39;s ideas together. I think you guys as instructors can also notice that as a group, we are usually missing 1-2 people per class.",
"I feel like our team needs to get together more often so that we could get things done on time. I suggested that we meet up on the weekends but most of us have to work on those days. I believe that we can make it, but I&#39;m still stressed out. Sometimes I worry too much and it&#39;s keeping me from enjoying life.",
I make my best with my teammate,
"While we still need to work out scheduling, ultimately I am very pleased with my team and enjoy their company and contributions to the project. So far, communication has been good, and contributions have been distributed fairly and evenly among the different group members. Overall, I look forward to working with them for the rest of the semester. ",
I am happy with my team. Everyone gets along well and we all work together and do our best to help each other out. ,
"I&#39;m always doing 90% of the work myself because half of my team simply doesn&#39;t care about the project. Some of my teammates do cooperate and do what is asked of them, but often times do a poor job just to get done quickly. I&#39;m not saying this to have someone reprimand them because I&#39;ve talked to them about the situation myself, but since the survey asks for input, I figured I&#39;d mention what is going on.",
Team is great.,
"I really enjoy my team. We are full of enthusiasm, and always go the extra mile in our work. ",
"Great team.
",
"My team is surprisingly good, we mesh well together.  Sometimes we don&#39;t get the work done we need to, but we still get things done.",
every one seems to be working well together and contributes to the task.,
Group leader dropped out.,
"Kenji has missed several meetings and neglects to respond in the group chat. Also he has frequently been late due to &ldquo;sleeping in&rdquo;.  My team insists on giving equal credit to everyone, but I am bothered by the fact that he will either be hours late or not show up at all. ",
Its all good :),
My team worked together and eventually we got through it ,
my team is pretty good but without me it would&#39;ve been a disaster. but we work really well together and everyone was trying to help as much as they could.,
Love my team except Nelson,
This class was a lot of work but I&#39;m that my team made it through this whole assignment with no problems within the team.,
I&#39;ve been complaining about my team all semester. Clearly this survey has no effect.,
Overall a good team experience ,
Ole and Kyler does not reply in the group chat and they are never the one to start mentioning that we have work to be done. They do not care about our team and our project. I am always trying to get the team to work however Ole and Kyler would never reply me. ,
"Towards the end of building our Hovercraft both Anjie and Janell were the first people to point fingers. I told them all that I would be missing work due to health concerns, as I suffer from Crohn&#39;s disease and am trying to figure out how I can manage it better. Even if I ended up doing more work on my own, it didn&#39;t seem to matter to them because I wasn&#39;t with them. Ole was very considerate of my ailment and I never had any problems with him. Anjie and Janell were different, however, because they were no longer very interested in mine and Ole&#39;s ideas, which made it extremely difficult to finish up our hovercraft. Thankfully Ole and I were able to calibrate the weight on our hovercraft, and we ended up getting a pretty good score on the final competition.",
"Overall a very good and dynamic team. Unfortunately one of our teammates, Eddie, dropped out so it was a struggle to make up for his absence.",
Hover Heathens,
"Kyle Cooper, Dana Winterringer and myself (Jeff Conocenti) did the entire project on our own. Kyle is extremely smart and very patient, he had handled most of the calculations along with a lot of the paperwork, for example the journals and papers. Kyle also contributed to input of ideas on how to fix the hovercraft when it wasn&#39;t working properly. Dana handled the coding of the hovercraft as well as soldered most of the wiring. She contributed a great deal to the project as a whole. I myself handled putting together the entire hovercraft. I did almost all of the hands on work as well as contributed to the papers. However, Alyssa Richmond and Bailey Fulton did next to nothing to contribute to this project. Alyssa seemed like she had good intentions. She came to most of the meets with a few exceptions that had good excuses. However when she was here she did nothing to contribute. She would watch us work without giving any sort of input. She did not work on any of the paperwork, and when we would ask something very simple from her she would give us a nasty look and a bad attitude. Bailey Fulton on the other hand was quite the opposite of Alyssa. Bailey was always &quot;busy&quot; and was never able to make it to any of the meetings. Over the time of the semester we met as a group for approximately 100 hours, Kyle and I missed none of those hours, Dana was there about 95% of the time, Alyssa, about 60% and bailey worked with us approximately 5-10 of those hours.  However when he was there he did help. But he would never respond in the group chat and never had a good excuse for why he was absent. ",
Alyssa and Bailey really don&#39;t contribute much to the project. Bailey ghosted us during the project 4 and project 5 deadlines. Alyssa comes to the meetings but doesn&#39;t actually help with anything.,
"Honestly I will admit that I missed quite a few meetings near the end, but when I was there I helped a lot. I got really busy near the end. When at meetings I helped to make the needed changes to make our hovercraft work. Even though I was often missing but still helped, Alyssa, while always there, never helped. We often looked back on our work and realized that she almost never touched the hovercraft and was reluctant to do even the smallest task asked of her, check something out. That said I am overall very happy with the group and thought we mostly worked well together. ",
"Group projects are always a horror story, but in this case even with such a difficult project to accomplish it could have been worse. ",
"Kyle and Jeff were outstanding teammates. I and them actively participated and showed up to all meetings unless we absolutely couldn&#39;t. Alyssa showed up every time, however lacked in complete, active participation. Bailey frequently did not show up and did not make an excuse as to why, however actually did work when he was there. Overall though, it was manageable and we finished strong.",
Had a great team of guys. Made the class very enjoyable.,
Loved working with teammates this semester!!!,
"Things have smoothed out a lot since the original dispute of who was doing more work of what type. For a while one of my group mates thought he was doing all the work because he was doing much of (and most of) the writing, however it was me ( and the other two along with me) that physically built the hovercraft. Once this was resolved that we were all doing equal amounts of different work we functioned perfectly as a team.",
The supposed &quot;team leader&quot; Anton contributed very little to the project. Failed to show up to meetings and missed labs. Very inconsistent and slowed our group down heavily. Evan worked hard and did everything he could for the hovercraft to work. Justin was not contributing at first but midway through he stepped up.,
"It was extremely difficult to finish this semester and task. However, it has proved to be a learning experience.",
"They were okay, but we got it done fast and fixed everything so I would say we worked well under pressure.",
Team 23 did an amazing job this semester. Everyone was great to work with.,
Shadow and Edward didn&#39;t really do that much but we got out work done so it&#39;s okay.,
N/A,
I think the team works really well together. We finished our final competition ahead of time and everything worked perfectly because everyone did their part.,
thank you for a great semester.  ,
woowee,
Rheanna doesn&#39;t do much for our team but she does do the team journals. She mainly sits there and reads her comics. This one time she told us that she couldn&#39;t meet with us to work on the hovercraft because she wanted to take a nap.  ,
"Our work distributions failed to reflect the amount of effort team members actually put into the project.  Jack and Drew did far less of the work than Jezra or I, and Jack and Drew spent probably half of the time at meetings watching videos or texting on their phones.
Jezra was a pleasure to work with.  He contributed thoughtful ideas, successfully debugged LabVIEW problems, stayed to get things done when they needed to get done, and was the only member other than myself who worked on the project outside of the meetings on his own time.  He was also very enthusiastic.  I sent an email to the group the day that teams were assigned, and Jezra responded immediately.  Unfortunately, the other two didn&#39;t respond and two weeks passed before we met as a team.
Jack routinely missed meetings.  He&rsquo;d frequently have an excuse as to why he couldn&rsquo;t show up when we met to work on the hovercraft.  Curiously, he was always able to show up for checkpoints to take credit for the work he didn&rsquo;t do.  On the occasion that he did show up, he&rsquo;d usually do sloppy work.  During one meeting he and I got into an argument.  He wanted to superglue the first idea we came up with despite demonstrable flaws (it was a crooked, high-friction axle).  I wanted to build parts for a better solution, that lacked the flaws, and that I&rsquo;d articulated the design of and then glue it together at the next meeting given that we had 3 weeks to finish our propulsion system.  Later in the meeting, after the other members had gone, leaving just me and Jack, he stopped working and preoccupied himself with his phone.  After about 30 minutes of whatever he was doing with the phone, he turned to me and explained that he wanted to leave because he was tired and had a hangover.  This was a Wednesday of a 5-day workweek.
On a later checkpoint, we agreed to try to finish CP5, the final competition, and the final design report in time for early bird extra credit.  The next day, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, Jack announced he was leaving for the week because he wanted to go snowboarding.  We&rsquo;d had to have finished CP5 that Wednesday.  Yet, after seeing Jack leave, Jezra and Drew skipped out for the week too.  That was the only bum thing Jezra did the entire semester.
When we drafted our final paper, both Jack and Drew submitted drafts for their sections that clearly didn&rsquo;t meet the assignment specifications.  This was after Drew had proposed that we not have a weekly group meeting talk about what had to be done and how we would divide the work because, as he put it, such a meeting would be a waste of time.  I can see how someone who spent half the meetings on his phone would think the meetings had been a waste of time.  But I can&rsquo;t imagine how someone who thinks reading the directions for his coursework is a waste of time could have made it into college.
The reason people in this class have problems getting along with their teams is that it&rsquo;s a freshman class at a school that admits people who don&rsquo;t belong in college.  Move it to sophomore year and bar entry to students enrolled in sub-100 level courses so the worst of the worst can flunk out before getting here rather than dragging down competent students.",
gimme A plis ,
"I am not very satisfied with working in this team. I am happy with the progress we&#39;ve made, but I am not very satisfied with how we&#39;ve had to work on the craft for the past few weeks. We&#39;ve had to do smaller meetings where not everyone can stay for long to contribute to the hovercraft. ",
N/A,
The team has started working together and we are going to finish strong as a team. We are getting work done as efficiently as possible. ,
"This class was a challenge, teamwork being a major difficulty.",
"Great team, we did well.",
No body in the group ever wanted to work. It was a struggle to get them to stay and work on the project for more than an hour. I finally got everyone to stay and we were able to complete the course. I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s complete. ,
I think we discussed the Andrew thing already. He is having a baby/getting married so we are content with covering for him.,
"I believe that my team members were awful this semester.  They were all very lazy and put in minimal effort.  Stephen probably did the most out of the other three because he was mainly in charge of programming the NXT.  Ryan helped here and there but didn&#39;t do much.  Elder didn&#39;t due jack shit all Semester.  I understand that this is a group project, but I do not believe my grade in the class reflects how much time and effort that I personally put into this project.  I could look at the project and honestly say that I probably built the entire thing by myself.  ",
"Neel Dhingra hadn&#39;t shown up since about the first week, so my team only consisted of three people. Other than that, I definitely enjoyed my team.",
Neel Dhingra hasn&#39;t shown up in over a month to any project meetings or class.,
"Since the beginning of the year, Taine has been behaving less than politely with the team, but they&#39;ve been such small and almost insignificant scenarios, so the rest of the team kind of just tolerated it. It used to not get in the way of our work, not too much, anyways. But within the past few weeks, he&#39;s just gotten much worse. He does all of his work either alone without telling anyone or just not at all. We all agreed that we were going to to our final design report this past Friday to get early bird bonus points, but he &quot;never knew&quot; that that&#39;s what we all wanted to do. Everyone else cut time out of their schedules to do up their portion of the report, everyone except Taine. My suspicion is that he just got lazy and wanted a few extra days to procrastinate, but I wouldn&#39;t want to assume anything. ",
Taine turned in his own Co11 paper and that was the lowest grade i received all semester.  I got an A in the class so I&#39;m not super bummed but it is frustrating that he turned in a paper behind our back.,
"Alex Honegger is constantly late, irresponsible, and forgetful. While he does do quality work we he is present, Alex is an unreliable teammate. Carson Garcia is great, he shows up on time, contributes ideas, and tries to be helpful when he can. Roedwilm Zach Princer is also irresponsible. He misses several work sessions, and when he does show up, he decides it to be the perfect time to put on head phones and take a nap. He doesn&#39;t contribute anything to our project and has essentially free-loaded off of all our work.",
I built the entire hovercraft by myself at times either when the rest of the team was not there or they sit around and did nothing. I did not mind building it on my own but the rest of my team did nothing but write the essay to earn their grade. ,
This has been a fantastic team!,
"I had a great group compared to my friends&#39; groups. Only one team member did not pull their full weight. Overall though, I am satisfied with my group.",
I am glad to be put on this team.,
"While I am not unsatisfied by the results (my team is currently in first place), I am upset at how much work I did myself.  On checkpoints 3, 4, and 5, my teammates were unavailable most of the time to work on the hovercraft, and I ended up doing 90% of the work myself.  I appreciate that Branden made up for not making it to build times (although be still made it to more than the other 2) by doing more than his fair share of the writing assignments.",
Stanley Chi never shows up to meetings and doesn&#39;t take part in helping team.,
"All has worked out well over the semester for the most part! Thank you.
",
"Thomas started out missing a few meetings, but stepped up majorly since the last CATME survey. He has not missed a meeting and has spent his own free time working on the project when others were pressed on time. By far, he has been the most enthusiastic and active member on the team.
On the other hand, since Checkpoint 4, Conner has not attended any meetings other than the required Skills Lab for the Final Exam. He has communicated vaguely or not at all (e.g., &quot;I might be free sometime Sunday afternoon&quot;). When others have been late or had to miss meetings, they were all prompt about notifying other team members and provided legitimate reasons for their absence (e.g., &quot;I can&#39;t make it today&quot;). He has contributed nothing to the project since the CO11 paper.",
"The evaluation I gave Connor is not entirely true because I had to choose between the options given, which does not fairly represent him. However, he rarely shows up to our meetings and when he does he does not provide a lot of input. Although he misses meetings and doesn&#39;t give a lot of input he never interrupts or discourages me or my other teammates so it seems to me his issue is just being present for our meetings and not helping as much as I think he could.",
"Please test the electronics students sell for next years class. I bought two fans that were listed as $80 and they both got fried. Also i didn&#39;t get a refund and to some, that may be issue that can escalate quickly.   ",
This was a good team with bad luck.,
"Robert and I did most of the work throughout the year, but towards the end Christian and Rachel picked up their weight. Although they didn&#39;t put a lot of effort throughout the year, I am satisfied that they put in as much work as they did in the end where it counted the most. ",
"Here&#39;s the rundown of the whole hovercraft process: Christian is present most of the time when we have team meets, but during those times he gives us 25/100% of his effort because either he goes and talks with other groups or plays on his phone. Then Robert shows up to group meetings rarely, it is extremely hard to get a hold of him even if we make many attempts to call or text him. When Robert does show up for group meetings most the time he is very late (which really sucks), and I understand he has some health problems that make it hard for him to come immediately. On the other hand, most of the tardiness could have been solved if he woke up earlier (his mom could have woke him up) because I tell the members to meet up days in advance if not a few days then at least 1 day in advance. Robert knew what time to be there by and wouldn&#39;t respond when we message him about it. Not only that, Robert does not want me to touch the hovercraft at all when he is there, he talks to me in a very very rude condescending way (he does the same for Christian but less), and some ideas me or either Christian has he completely shuts them down not in a kind considering way. I have done the majority of the writing in the group and Christian has helped. Robert and Joshua have not helped type up anything at all other than the hovercraft calculations. I am the only one in the group that wants to work on the hovercraft, every single time I have set up the hovercraft meetings because they will not do it on there own. I even had to set up their meetings together when I wasn&#39;t able (work) to come. The last thing I want to point out is that I am the only one in the group that has a job and works, the others live on campus and do less work than me. I can not say I&#39;m innocent in all of this though because since the others don&#39;t put in enough effort/care for this, I get stressed out to keep a good grade (if I didn&#39;t care the hovercraft probably wouldn&#39;t be made) that is why I am sometimes mean and forceful when it comes to my teammates. For this project, I know our group would have to meet up a lot, they don&#39;t go unless I force them into it. I&#39;ve tried being nice about asking to meet up, they do not show up when I do that. I have tried to go by the Team Charter to confront them about helping more it which doesn&#39;t work, it just makes the situation worse. Then tried giving them more work to do by themselves, that doesn&#39;t work. Lastly is talking to the TA which is why I&#39;m writing it on here. I wanted to inform the TA&#39;s earlier, but I have tried many things and did not want my team members to hate me more than they already do. We are close to our final competition since Josh and I spent a long time working on it this week. I do not think we need the help on how to fix the situation now, I just believe each person in our group did not know how to communicate with each other the whole time respectfully as well as not having the same amount of effort/care about our grades.",
we work well together taylor missed a lot of work this weekend because he was in disneyland,
This was a good team for the project.,
Nobody responds to me in our group chat and our hovercraft has stagnated because of it.,
"We did learn that failure is an option, but it should&#39;ve been done more frequently and efficiently. It costed us Checkpoints 4 &amp; 5. Regardless, I find this introductory course of Engineering very delightful.",
"My team from checkpoint 4 - 5 have been very lazy and work has only been completed the day before. There is a lot of issue going on and our hovercraft has suffered tremendously from the lack of communication and working together. I am very disappointing with the amount of work my team members have put in into this project and what&#39;s worse is that my grade is suffering because of it. My team members at this point seem to not have interest in even finishing the hovercraft for the final competition. Overall, I&#39;m disappointed that my grade will reflect on the lack of work they had done for the project.",
Myles left us in the start and we had to build with 3 people......,
Zuwenat was a little troublesome for me ,
I really wish Elizabeth pulled her weight during the project because she didn&#39;t contribute as much as she should have during the duration of the project.,
"Marco is a great teammate, Jared and Jakob are mediocre at best.",
"Contribution was more equal since last eval. Kevin is irritating when he&#39;s annoyed. Branden just slows us down sometimes. If we&#39;re all calm, there aren&#39;t really any issues. I don&#39;t like making the team members sign for their percentage of contribution because if it&#39;s less than equal, it&#39;s uncomfortable and annoying to deal with the person who did not contribute as much as the rest of us. No real problems occurred, however.",
"Adolfo doesn&#39;t do pretty much anything, he comes in exactly on time so we can never get prepared before lab with him, but he does come everyday and he does work in class, just not so much out of class, he&#39;s more outspoken and listens the most.
Marissa can be the rudest of the group, she doesn&#39;t listen to anyone, especially me, and takes over the &quot;fun&quot; parts of lab, however, shes a hard worker and does a lot of the work, plus she caries the hovercraft most of the time and turns in our reports. always early and always present
Jesse is very nice and understanding. he probably does the most amount of work, but hes very quiet and doesn&#39;t explain what he is doing.
all teammates work well on written projects, but they are always started the day before by everyone but me and done like an hour before they&#39;re due which stresses me out a lot",
Everything went well and we finished all we needed with little to no conflicts minor or otherwise. ,
"I really would have liked to have waited a few more days for the final run but I was out voted. However, I understand that democracy is part of a successful team dynamic. We turned in our design report today and overall I am very happy with the diversity of this group as our strengths all paired well. ",
Wish the hovercraft worked,
"Over the last few weeks, small issues that had been worked through before became major obstacles that impeded any meaningful progress. Brandon, Matt, and I made every effort to meet, but Shadrach was absent from all meetings except for the final competition. We had to scrap one hovercraft and build a completely new one two days before the final competition. Ultimately, we were only able to make it do the bare minimum, whereas if we had had about a week, and everybody&#39;s full cooperation, we would have been able to fully complete the project.",
i can tough it out,
Less group projects.,
none,
All Good,
"It has been a pleasure working with my team. We did experience issues with another team &quot;borrowing&quot; our battery charger without our permission and returning it, many days later, with a broken molex connector. This also happened the night before our checkpoint skills lab. Thankfully another team was kind enough and allowed us to use their charger so we were able to perform for the checkpoint that day.",
I have been stuck managing the entire project for my team and have built every single component while the group just groups together like a group of sheep.,
"Great teammates. Did a lot more work than they should of, because I had to go home every 2 weeks, and didn&#39;t complain about it all.",
"Other members of the team decided to finish a week early to get credit for the final competition. After bringing the hovercraft home to work on it the night before we&#39;d do the final competition, I brought it in for that purpose. I texted my team asking where they were and they asked why we were meeting. It was the only day our TA would be there to grade us. Two of my teammates eventually showed up, but the last one never did. Ethan said afterward he would draft up the final design report over the weekend to finally take some of the workload off of me, as he has said many times before with other tasks, but it never happened. Matt was very helpful during this portion of the project, as we had to completely redesign our non-functional propulsion system, and he designed and built it mostly on his own. I understand the rest of my teammates have other responsibilities with life and other classes, but it is a bit disappointing none of them could portion enough time to contribute more to the project. ",
"Even though Kody was frequently absent and usually did not contribute as much as the rest of the team, he was a great teammate and that should not be held against him. Most of the time, Brendan and Ethan would be so efficient that there was simply not that much left for Kody and me to do, which actually turned out to be a very productive team dynamic.",
"Considering that it is much closer to the end of the project and the majority of the work has already been completed, we have not been meeting at a regular bases. Some of that can be because of the Thanksgiving break and others are prioritizing to work on other classes. It has been difficult to plan a group meeting, but our hovercraft is complete and working. Zahidul has been the most active in trying to coordinate the group through text, but since he is not the one in possession of the hovercraft, we are usually left to program without much testing.",
For checkpoints 4 and 5 Mathew and I spent about 20 hours each while working on this project together. The rest of the team put about 5 hours each.,
"I feel that if we had smaller or bigger groups, it wouldn&#39;t matter, our team couldn&#39;t be more compatible. We surprisingly get things done, despite our schedules. We really dont have any problems other than relying on luck/chance 15% of the time. But we our proud of our hovercraft, we couldn&#39;t be more satisfied.",

My group and I work very well and I believe that my success in the class is partially due to the team I was put into and the way we interact as a group.,
"Travis has probably been one of the worst teammates I have had the pleasure to work with. He has shown no interest or effort to complete any tasks, and has continually come up with excuses for leaving or not participating. His complaints are not unique, and we all have the same type of things going on.",
"I do most of the work.  One member on the team likes to make &ldquo;smart&rdquo; comments after the fact about what could have been done but didn&rsquo;t like to contribute to fixing the problems. Another member can&rsquo;t do anything by himself, everything he does has to be revised and looked over. Another member caused us to fail the one thing that he was responsible for this semester. Luckily we were given extra time to revise but I ended up having to do it last minute because he just didn&rsquo;t do it.",
"Katherine has said she would help the team by taking care of journals etc., but we end up doing it because she waits until the last minute and then has an excuse as to why she couldn&#39;t get it done. Also, she never shows up on time, if she even shows up at all, to team meetings.",
"This project was very trying, and Justin took over the project so it got worse.",
Kingston Morgan hasnt shown up or responded to texts in months,
We had a teammate who never showed up for labs or meetings since the first time we are assigned our group.  That was Kingtson Morgan.  ,
"Throughout the entire semester, Nathaniel Kankoski failed to do his part for: the Design Concept Report, Checkpoint 4, CO11 P aper, Checkpoint 5, Final Competition, and the Final Report. When he did not do his part, he left Christian, Clifford, and mainly me to cover for his work. Nathaniel does little to participate in the group effort by not engaging in finding work to contribute and attempts to leave as soon as he can. In addition, he fails to show communication with us; when texted, he does not respond whatsoever. However, I do admit that I have failed to speak up about the issue. But don&#39;t ignore the fact that Kankoski also did not try to own up to his own mistakes. During the meetings is he primarily jokes around rather than participate.",
Nate in our group has gone MIA and hasn&#39;t helped us with our hovercraft in the past 2-3 weeks.,
"This was a great team, they were the first new friends that I made at this school and I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better team. We worked hard and it paid off, we ended up getting 100% on the final competition. ",
I&#39;m really grateful for my team. I&#39;m glad I got paired with them. We all contribute equally and they make this a fun project.,
"My group isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad, but it definitely isn&rsquo;t good. The main problem is stems from the laziness and lack of effort from 2 of the members. I can say that I have definitely done around 80% of the work so far, another member has done roughly 10%, and the remaining two members have each done 5%. I&rsquo;m the designated team leader so I expected to put a little more work in then everyone else but it seems I&rsquo;m the only one who really cares about my grade. It&rsquo;s not that I have bad teammates, it&rsquo;s that I need an A for a GPA requirement while the other members are okay with a C. Because of this discrepancy, I&rsquo;m forced to carry the team to an A. ",
i enjoy being on my team :),
Jeff patronizes team members for their ideas more then he used to.,
Been a great time with a great team. ,
Yay we are done!,
None,
My team is the best in the world!!!!!,
Our group worked extremely well together and completed all of our work. It was a fun project!,
:D,
Joshua Webb continues to not contribute his fair share to the project.,
Our team works very well together.,
Tony J is the man,

"Tony J is the man, dude",
I am very ready to be done with this project.,
This was a good team to work with.,
.,
No comments.,
Good team.,
"I think my team is incredible, and we work very well together to create the hovercraft we&#39;ve made. No troubles ever really came, and whenever one member needed help, the others would come as soon as possible with ideas. It is the greatest pleasure to work alongside these new friends of mine.",
"why did the scarecrow get the award?
he was outstanding in his field!",
"Cant wait to be done with this hovercraft
",
"I had an amazing team, they all worked together well and got thier assigned activities done on time and as expected.",
"Good semester, good people, good class",
"Overall this team was fine to work with, Ben would show up a lot of the time and then would just stay on his phone and complain when the other teammates weren&#39;t there. However, other then that we worked fine together, we got our assignments done on time and worked off of our different ideas and experiences. ",

"For the most part, things have been normal. However, Connor and I recently had some disagreements while working on the final report. He made the wiring schematic of the report, and I disagreed with the way he presented the relay switch between the fans and batteries. However, he wouldn&#39;t listen, and argued with me on it. I discontinued the conversation quickly, because I could tell the conversation was going nowhere, and I was getting upset. Was this a problem that likely won&#39;t amount to anything significant? Probably, but it was still upsetting, and it was rude of him to immediately turn my disagreement away.",

2 people carried the team :^),
"As a team we have developed a strong understanding of each other. I am very pleased with our progress as well our work ethic.
",
"I am really happy on how this team project worked out, with a team that worked really well with each other professionally and casually. We were always hanging out with each other when we weren&#39;t working on our craft, getting along well and being interested in what we all were up to. When we would meet up, we would go into work mode putting everything together and doing extensive tests. Like I said before, I am really happy with how it went!",
I believe that more tables for hovercraft testing should be invested in.  ,
"Things started off great but our team has a hard time evenly distributing the work load, evenly contributing, listening and respecting others ideas. ",
The project overall was a enjoyable experience and the team I was placed in worked well when we all managed to find a time where we all could meet. ,
N/A,
"Despite my own biases, I feel that I have done the most work out of anyone in this project. I have never missed a meeting. I wrote the final report and a great deal of the design report on my own, I programmed the project&#39;s control system on my own, and did just about all of the calculations back when originally designing the hovercraft&#39;s lift system. This is all on top of my responsibilities pertaining to meeting with my team to build the hovercraft. Sometimes I had to work alone in the EDL to build it. I was always able to make time for this project.
My teammates did not take advantage of me and I am glad that I was able to work with them, they are good partners and from what I can understand they had extremely busy schedules that they did their best to work around. However I do feel as if I did a disproportionately larger amount of work this semester.",
N/A,
I really enjoyed having this group as my hovercraft team. I hope to work with them again in the near future,
Having only three teammates makes it tough on us. Especially if someone cannot make it to the meeting due to all of our busy schedules.,
"My team often makes plans to meet during times when I am not available. I have made it abundantly clear that I am not available on Tuesdays or Thursdays.
I&#39;ve had to leave work during the middle of two shifts because they &quot;forgot&quot; to tell me they were meeting.
They also often make plans to meet and then do not inform me until the time of meeting, saying that &quot;they forgot.&quot;
At most meetings my ideas get shut down and usually I am completely ignored until about ten minutes later when one of them has the exact same idea.
They try to give me less percent on the group project even though I do all of the team journals, most of both reports, and show up to the meetings that I am told about.",
You are awesome!! have a great Winter Break (:,
"It seems like we never get anywhere as a group, deadlines are being missed and with the departure of Juliette, no one else had any desire to finish the project. The language barrier is still a big issue with Yinkai, as Jared and I are pulling most of his weight because he can only contribute so much to the hovercraft. I felt like I did a pretty good job overall in the class but this project will impact my grade in a way that says otherwise. ",
"The team does not want to show up to meetings, complete work, respond to messages and it is overall not an enjoyable experience",
This group has effectively come together to complete our tasks in an efficient and quality manner.,
Only two of us are putting forth effort in the whole project.,
"The mistakes my team had made up until now were harmless, however, the teammate who I entrusted to charge the batteries on the hovercraft did not do so. As a result, on the day of checkpoint 5 we were unable to get the hovercraft to even hover in the most basic way resulting in a score of 0 out of 35 on our checkpoint. Additionally, this past week neither of my teammates were willing to meet to put necessary work into our hovercraft just one day before the checkpoint, as a result I spent much time alone in the EDL working on the hovercraft. Up until now I was willing to put up with these types of actions for the sake of my grade and the overall quality of the project, but after the hard work I put into this hovercraft I am no longer willing to do so. With one more week remaining as a group, I understand that complaints about my teammates will not do me much good, but I felt that within this evaluation, it was necessary for context.",
It has been a pleasure working with this team. We complemented each other&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. I feel like we accomplished our project and goal well. ,
"Very Happy with the team, we had a great time working together.",
"Want to let you know that despite the work distribution sheet saying we each contributed 25% to the project this last stretch, Blake Cahill did nothing all week but fill out the paper, saying he did 25%, during our final evaluation. unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t have time to argue as the TA was rushing us to get the final evaluation signed and turned in and i just wanted to get this project finished after working on it all week. Nick Sanchez and I did pretty much everything for the entire project it&rsquo;s help from Blake Tuter. I cant think of one contribution Blake Cahill made at all during this entire project. But I&rsquo;m just glad this project&rsquo;s finally over. ",
"I have no additional comments for this class. I am somewhat relieved that this semester is coming to an end soon. It was a stressful 15 weeks, but I am glad that it is over.",
We&#39;ve been getting along with each other and we barely have any predicaments now thankfully.,
"Because we are near the end of the project, the team morale and efficiency has dropped significantly. Team members are not responding to messages, some don&#39;t show up to meetings, and the hovercraft is not finished yet. I find our team dynamic to be destructive to our progress and the attitude has been quite negative. I am worried that my team no longer cares how we perform on the final checkpoint.",
Most of the time when we are suppose to meet they never showed up or they just showed up hours later. ,
Christopher has not been contributing enough and he always some excuse when ever we are trying to for a long time. He always wants to leave early. But other than that everything has been fine.,
"This project was actual hell for me.  It was mostly during checkpoint 4 and 5 where I was the only one contributing.  Robert literally did nothing, at the end he tried, but I would give him an F.  I like him as a person if that counts for anything.  Dia slacked in the beginning and at the end she turned out to be really good.  Eddy was helpful,but during the checkpoint 4 and 5 time, he slacked, but in the end he was very helpful too.  I did pretty much all the work, but Dia and Eddy I could say I was overall pleased with them.",
"I think our team lacks team work. Everyone seems so busy. It is hard to find a time to meet up. When we do meet up, it is for an hour and we can&#39;t get anything done in an hour. I feel like the extra workload gets put on me. It is fine if I know how to do it, but I don&#39;t. I feel like I can&#39;t do anything right. Every time we have our group meetings, the EDL is really full so it is hard find a location to get things done.
I just feel so stressed since we&#39;ve been failing the checkpoints. Since I seem less busy compared to some people, I do attend all the meetings so I feel that it is my fault for those failures. ",
I have recently stepped up my effort on the hovercraft project since lectures ended and I currently have done most of the design and building process my self. I don&#39;t like to talk bad about others or complain but I truly feel that so far I have done most of this project my self. ,
Jesse likes to make comments under his breath that people cannot hear that are rude and demeaning and generally very unhelpful. I only notice cause I learned to read lips with a friend who is deaf a while back. I do not appreciate the things he says. And Alberto does not show up on time and the work he turns in to the group is half-completed or sloppy and sometimes needs to be redone. These groups need to be configured better. All our schedules are a mess and no one is willing to stick to the predetermined times and there needs to be a better way to do these team things...,
"Both Alberto and Jesse lack initiative and are not reliable when it comes to meeting attendance, communication, and doing their share of the work. Mit is very defensive of her ideas and fails to hear Alberto&#39;s, Jesse&#39;s, and mine&#39;s opinions. She is close-minded and will, more often that not, not even entertain our ideas; but instead shoot them down or list off reasons as to why it would not work without trying the idea.",
"When answering the questions on Team Satisfaction, I ignored Davis Troyer because he has basically ghosted the rest of the group for the past 2 checkpoints. Other than him, I am very satisfied with my group. ",
"Everything is great with Cameron and Adam but Davis does not communicate whatsoever, and his future grades will reflect that in our journal.",
"There are times I feel ignored or interrupted by some of my teammates. They are usually right, but it can be frustrating. ",
"At times, it feels like members do not want to be present when at meetings. This may just be due to fatigue and stress from all other aspects of college life. There has not been an issue that we haven&#39;t been able to resolve. ",
Matthew has missed two meetings and is quite late to many of them as well as leaves early for a majority of rest. He makes the minimal attempt to attend the meetings as well. Josh and Deev are active members and work well with everyone else and has gone to all meetings on time. He is on his last strike in terms of missing meetings before he is going to be reported and the amount of work that he does is minimal in terms of contribution to checkpoints and projects. He has done some work the last meetings and I hope that he starts to work more often now that he is on the last strike.,
"I think that my team is getting everything done and mostly everyone is doing their fair-share of work. However, Matthew is often late or absent from team meetings and it is hard to communicate with him as he rarely responds to texts. He does well when he shows up, but he just needs to be more proactive.",
"Lately David seems to be neglecting some of his responsibilities, and the last few team meetings we have had were dependent on david remembering items, or getting something done before he came, and he didn&#39;t and we were unable to accomplish our goals at the meetings. He also gets pretty firm ideas of what he wants to do and doesn&#39;t consult the team very much, or just goes forward with his ideas. He&#39;s a very nice guy, and it could just be the semester work piling up on him, but he has been fairly neglectful lately, and is preventingour team from completing checkpoints on time.",
"The team is working together fairly well. I wish people were more prepared when they showed up for meetings. At first there were several members who no call/ no showed for meetings, but I brought it up that it was not acceptable to do stuff like that, and everyone has seemed to be more focused since then. The biggest problem i have is when people show up with work done, but it is not done to the quality that it should be done. This causes a problem because I don&#39;t have time to do their portion of the assignment myself, nor I am I in a position to tell them to go redo it, yet my grade is negatively effected by their work.    ",
I am very disappointed with my group.  They have very poor communications skill and are very  lazy.  Two out of the three team mates have barely done anything.  I would probably be more productive and efficient by myself.,
"Roedwilm Zach Princer makes no contributions, misses meetings regularly, and is unreliable. when he does manage to make an appearance we ask him to take off his headphones and but his game away, and he does, but then doesn&#39;t make any real contributions. We are probably more productive on the days he fails to show up. Alex Honegger is overbooked, he is consistently late, and too busy to meet as often as we&#39;d like, although his contributions are helpful and he is a valuable member of this team, he isn&#39;t very punctual.",
"Only problem is that I haven&#39;t really been asked to do anything and I could not make the last meeting where we started building as we scheduled it on a day I had work, and I ended up getting called in early so I have not participated as much as I&#39;d like.",
"Stanley never does any work, my group hardly has the time to get together.  When we do get together only 3/5 of us show up.  Almost everything is done last minute.",
"difficulties because of the availability of all the teammates, difficulties to meet and difficulties because of my schedule of tennis tournaments.",
I enjoy working with Robert Yup immensely. The other two I can&#39;t exactly say the same for. Rachel and Christian don&#39;t necessarily show drive to work on the hovercraft build itself. They just seem to want to do the write ups more or less. ,
"Last evaluation, I mention that the only problem my team had was that their was no communication within our group. So far, that has slightly gotten better. We all work together very well and when we do our assign task, everyone seems to be able to complete their part. As time goes on, our team will be able to meet up more frequently to complete the hovercraft.",
"At this point Myles is completely unavailable. He has shown up for a single skills lab and that has been it. he does not respond to messages both personal and in the teams group chat. He has not been a part in designing the hovercraft nor any other decisions. My team remains behind everyone else because we have poor communication and conflicting schedules. I do most, if not all, the work when it comes to journals, checkpoints, and papers. Marlon and Richard are smart, capable team members, but I believe that we have gotten too far behind and require assistance from either Tony J. or our actual professors to get back on track. I&#39;m honestly not sure how we came to get so far behind, but I don&#39;t want to do poorly in this class and would like to finally get some footing on creating this hovercraft.",
WE dont do anything.,
"Myles and Richard never want to meet, in fact Myles has never been to a team meeting and Richard only half. Most of the time is just me and Jackson it just doesn&#39;t seem fair. We didn&#39;t completed checkpoint 2 because Myles decided to take a one week vacation from school and didn&#39;t tell us and he had our kit.",
"Elizabeth needs to be able to communicate better. She demands instead of ask, but her work needs to be done better due to the fact that what she works on has caused our group to lose points. Other teammates take interest and listen to each other.",
Some in our group refuses to meet in the times they told us multiple times that they could and one refuses to drive to meetings on weekends,
Marco Bui is a great teammate. He goes well beyond what is expected and always works hard on whatever we are trying to complete. Jakob and Jared do not have their schedules planned very well and are never able to work on the hover craft so Marco and I pick up their slack.,
"Kevin and Branden just don&#39;t always communicate their thoughts, plans, or actions very well. Bethany and I live on campus so it&#39;s a bit easier for us to meet up and work on the project. I would trust Bethany without checking work; I can&#39;t say the same for the other two.",
"During the labs, i kind of feel excluded and would like to do more on hands work. I always do the team journals and would sometimes like it if we traded off on doing it because i hate evaluating everyone, it makes me feel awkward. I would like to understand what we are doing more, but no one really explains anything and when we meet up we don&#39;t do much. the last checkpoint no one did anything until like 8 pm the night before and i would like it more if we were prepared earlier. this meeting today we are meeting in the lab to work on our hovercraft and hopefully we will get a lot done and i can have a part in it. Despite us not meeting up much and doing everything separately, we do still get all the work done and I&#39;m grateful for that. Also, they&#39;re very nice.",
"Jason is struggling to show up to meetings and/or communicate weather he will or will not be present at a meeting. its not an issue yet, simply noticeable. he is doing better about staying on task during meetings. The rest of the team is working well together. We are motivated to complete the projects and tasks on time, or before, and all are willing to put in the extra work needed to make this project happen effectively.",
"Everyone does their tasks. However, Shadrach is sometimes late to meetings and was late for the lab, which the group needed parts from him for the checkpoint. Luckily, he wasn&#39;t too late for the TA check but if this becomes a habit, then we as a group will discuss it.",
"Jackie does not do a fair share of her work, but she says she is going to make up for it so hopefully she does",
Andrew Wischer has not communicated with the group and does not show up to work with the group.,
One team member delivers sloppy work that is not acceptable.,
"For the most part our team works exceptionally well together, the only outlier to this statement is Fernando. He rarely can make meetings and has little to no input, ultimately this has no affect on the progress of the rest of the team however it certainly has no benefit either. David also misses every other weekend due to health reasons, I do not hold this against him however it is the reason for less contribution on his part.",
"David and Fernando have both been missing out on a lot of the work and with the way we&rsquo;ve divided it, I&rsquo;ve been doing all of the building and soldering with some help from Chandler and Jeremy and Chandler have been doing all of the Calculations and paperwork. Meanwhile Fernando and David sit and just watch us work and don&rsquo;t offer much help at all. I am very happy to work with Chandler and Jeremy but David and Fernando are not pulling their weight at all.",
"None of my teammates like working proactively on this project. I am still the only one who keeps track of assignment requirements and due dates. They do the things I assign to them for the most part, but I&#39;ve still had some things pushed back on me that they did not want to do or couldn&#39;t complete in time themselves. ",
"Everyone is pulling their fair share of work and i feel like Josh is picking up more of Zahidul&#39;s slack. Zahidul doesn&#39;t really do much, I still feel like he is just going along for the ride. He hasn&#39;t even completed his own share of work. But I feel like Josh is doing a lot of the work for our group. He really wants us to do good. I feel the same way about Aaron and Joel. Joel had a rough week, he kept really trying to help but he just getting the information wrong. But overall I really like working with my group except Zahidul.",
"Although Zahidul is present to all the meetings, I feel like he is just there in hopes that his presence equals contributing, when has little in put to provide. Because he is  hoping to be in computer science, hopefully he is able to step up when it come to programming.
Aaron has stepped up from the prior checkpoint, being involved in correcting issues when it arises, even if that means stressing the team out by fixing an issue that may not need to be corrected near a checkpoint deadline.
Everyone else is putting in an even amount of work.",
"This week I, Rebecca, was extremely sick with a fever and had an incident of fainting I was amazed with how chaotic things got without me. Smit is definitely not pulling his weight in the team",
A few team members don&rsquo;t show up on time or don&rsquo;t do their share of the work. Not showing up on time really irritates me because my commute time is by far the longest out of my team and I have been on time to all the team meetings. Relying on some of my teammates is a difficult thing to do because to be honest their work ethic and attitude show that they don&rsquo;t care about the project. I also have been buying most of the supplies and only one person has paid me back the 40 dollars they own me. Overall my team really needs to have a meeting to fix some of the issues that have been happening.,
"As the workload becomes more intense, and the group splits up some of the duties, I find myself going over other people&rsquo;s work half the time and basically making it my work because it&rsquo;s riddled with errors. They don&rsquo;t follow instructions all that well when the hovercraft design concept report was turned I as a google doc instead of a pdf. I had to ask the morning after because I figured it would happen and it did. ",
"I do more work than everyone else.  Keegan has helped a lot with the building of the hovercraft and the design of it but as for all of the written things, not much contribution.  John and Joseph help more with the written things than with the building.",
"I haven&#39;t seen Kingston in a few weeks but he&#39;s contacted me outside of class, disregarding his role as a group member. ",
"My teammates seem to have really A LOT of experience with almost every single aspect of this project and more. It makes it hard to step in and give my two cents whenever I can but its really hard when they jump on it without hesitation. I am doing what I can to learn as much as I can yet they are very proficient in this class and seem to have already done all of this when this is brand new to me. it makes it hard for me to learn because I am not necessarily hands on. I am doing my part by attempting to put my foot in every where I can. for instance , I am taking charge of writing our Essay on the production of a raw material.",
"Jason still hardly does anything. He&rsquo;s always late to labs, and he also doesn&rsquo;t communicate with the team well, even though he&rsquo;s on his phone all the time. He&rsquo;ll do one or two things and then leave us, saying that he has stuff come up for his fraternity as an excuse to get out of the meetings. Really uncool and annoying ",
"Lately, I have felt very excluded in the design of my hovercraft. For instance, I planned and showed up to every meeting we had, but I wasn&#39;t really welcomed to participate in the actual build of the hovercraft. I wanted to be hands on, but it was very clear to me that I wasn&#39;t trusted to be. This resulted in me giving the most of the workload to the guys because, while they did do most of the work in actually building the hovercraft, I was shut down when I tried to help. The guys in my group kind of took control and shut out me and Taylor. I feel like they don&#39;t value my input most of the time because they think they are smarter than me. While it is true that they probably have the tiniest bit more experience than me in design projects like this, this is an introductory class and I don&#39;t appreciate the fact that I have to walk away from my team meetings feeling discouraged and not smart enough. If I have questions (which I frequently do because I am trying to learn and a key part of the design process is to question the design early to avoid mishaps further along the line), I don&#39;t want to feel judged for them. I plan on discussing these feelings at my next team meeting. ",
team has been really good besides someone sleeping through a meeting time for extra credit on the stable hover checkpoint when he had the hover craft,
"Again, Joshua Webb fails to help or even try to help. During the last checkpoint, when all of us were working on the hovercraft, he decided it was more important to watch the Cubs game and then has the audacity to get mad when we give him a 1% in contribution.",
JC does not do anything,
"just unsatisfied with the class as a whole
",
All of the items needed and bought were done by one person. We discussed who wanted to buy items and tried to distribute the task. The tasks were not able to be done and I took the initiative to buy all the items that were not purchased. Which prolonged our hovercraft from being worked on because of vital items that were being shipped later on.,
"I only don&#39;t like working on this team as they do not communicate well about what they are doing, or when they plan on finishing their part. There have been instances that someone hasn&#39;t showed up to something they were supposed to causing me to complete their share along with mine, although this is reflected in the percentage of work I don&#39;t appreciate being &quot;stood up&quot;. There hasn&#39;t been time to address this with them as they were not at the engineering meeting and they weren&#39;t answering their phone.",
"I feel as though there may be too many cooks in the kitchen. I don&#39;t feel that I am able to contribute as much to my group for this reason. We get along fine, and get the work done, it just seems that we have to assign more busy work than anything.",
"Hello Professors,
My group is not working that well together. I know our schedules are incompatible but the times we can meet, people always seem to come late to meetings. During the meetings, time is not being spent wisely, i.e. people are standing around or just on their phones while another is doing a task. As well, I feel as if I keep having to remind everyone that we need to meet and clearly outline our tasks otherwise it seems they might not get done. For example, my group did not realize we had the design concept due until 2 days before and I am always reminding everyone about the journals and minutes requiring completion and then often doing them myself. Today I was doing the journal since no one else did and told them that, because of our limited time, they should start working on the hovercraft. However, they waited around until I was done. When I am filling out the journal and outlining the next tasks, I keep suggesting that we divide into pairs to work since our scheduling is difficult but they typically want to work altogether, and we have difficulty planning those meetings, and then people either come late or leave early. Additionally, during our checkpoint 3, one of our two fans was not working at all, thankfully it was okay and we were able to pass because our deck is smaller than originally planned. However, I wanted to talk about what we are going to do about this, whether that be ordering a new fan or something else, after or at least soon after the checkpoint, but they said we would do it later.  Per what seems to be the norm, I am worried we will not even talk about this again till much later and then this big decision will be rushed. Thank you for listening to my concerns and I simply wanted to make sure you were aware of them. If you have any advice, that would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you,

"As explained before, there are only slight personality things that annoy me, but not so much that I can&#39;t continue working as if nothing were wrong.
Since the last cat me evaluation, nothing has happened where I asked a question and was almost ignored in response.
However, Connor still makes comments about Matt&#39;s group interactions. In fact, just earlier today, Matt was telling someone something he found interesting, and Connor very sarcastically went &quot;oh wow.&quot; Again, it isn&#39;t damaging to our own team, but it&#39;s not super enjoyable working with sarcastic people like that.",

"Me and Nathan have supplied most of the financial funds. Ben has provided most of the... I don&#39;t know what he has done. Ben tries to do everything and freaks out when stuff doesn&#39;t go his way. Example: he got 2 motors online to use in hovercraft, one of said motors did not work. Instead of testing the second motor out he freaked out and tried to destroy the motor yelling &quot;I NEED AN A!!!&quot;. He failed at the first attempt to pull the motor apart and decided to take a second to breath with anger. Taking his further pent up frustrations of being an &quot;ass hat&quot; ,excuse my language, he used his hidden hulk strength to finally break the motor apart. While witnessing this display of nerd force, I tried to calm him down, saying there is another motor. He exclaimed that they are all broken because it was made by the same company. He then slumped down and I thought he was going to go on another hulk smash rage... So i told him that we would find another one. To which he responded with &quot;there are no more that we can order!&quot;. I went to a neighboring table or two and they all had motors that they had purchased in stores not far away. We made a plan to acquire more motors and that was that.
Bryson is a sack of turnips. I don&#39;t know what he is doing nor the location of his person. I asked him to purchase a mouse trap and he went to Walmart and said they sold out of &quot;nose traps&quot; WTF is a nose trap. Maybe he meant to type in mouse trap but auto correct did something wrong. Anyways I call BS that Walmart ran out of mouse traps.
Nate... He is an angel in a coven of heathens. Me and him spent 240 plus dollars on this stupid project. Together we have spent 2x the amount we should of. 80 bucks each is what we agreed upon and bryson and ben have not lived up to their side of the bargain.
In conclusion - Nate and Amir = good
Bryson and ben = bad
I am happy though to have the team that I have. A real team in the real world can be ugly. By using the experience gained from this project I will be better prepared for real world application. ",
The only reason for the mark downs on Bryson for his repetitive absents to our meetings that we have schedules via a group message that he is apart of and sees the messages of. Bryson has decent contribution when present but these continuing occurrences are somewhat becoming irritating. Nothing personal against Bryson.,
"Cyrus is beginning habits of &quot;no call no show&quot; recently. Communication with Yinkai is improving, but didn&#39;t do any research or contribute in any way for the CO11 paper even though he said he would. Jareds behavior is somewhat improving, still a little negative but showing up more and listening to ideas and completing work. I myself am losing focus, concentration and hope with this project as it gets later in the semester from frustration on not being able to understand some things and not understanding why my teammates can&#39;t just be truthful when they won&#39;t be to meetings instead of going &quot;ghost&quot;.",
"We had our mini meet up with the professors, and I feel just about the same as I did then. ",
Im worried  that my team does not communicate effectively or is proactive about addressing the coming checkpoints in a timely  fashion,
"Our communication is still lacking and work is completed inefficiently. We work well enough as a group, but our success is not at the level that it should be. We are able to buckle down when necessary and have met our goals, but rarely exceed our goals.",
Kush needs to focus more on getting work done first then having fun. He seems to always be missing for a majority of our latest meetings since the last CATME evaluation and tends to put minimal effort in helping. The rest of the group has to suffer and put even more time and effort into the project because Kush has other priorities then working on a project that&#39;ll decide whether he&#39;ll be an engineering major or not.,
"During the time we had to complete checkpoint 2, no one was specifically assigned to buy the parts so I took the initiative to buy the parts. I wasn&#39;t sure what fans we decided on buying so I kept asking about the website and no one was responding. It was about a week before checkpoint two and they finally gave me the website and I ordered it. Even when others could&#39;ve taken the initiative, Tommy still got mad that I ordered the fans &quot;late&quot;, when any other person in the group could&#39;ve bought the fans including Tommy. Our group is lacking communication, and whenever I ask a question I don&#39;t get a straight answer back. It&#39;s been stressful working with this group because they seem to procrastinate, and I have an A in this class and I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s getting lower because of this team.",
Christoper Simms was slacking a lot for checkpoint which resulted in me and Alejandro had to complete the entire checkpoint on our own. He only came the last day we were working on the checkpoints but still didn&#39;t help us that much that day too. Which resulted in us getting a lower grade on the checkpoint. He has said that he will be contributing more in checkpoint 4 we will just have to keep a watch on him because he has started to be lazy. Otherwise everything is good as of right now nothing to worry except Christoper&#39;s laziness.,
"I do not feel like I am being acknowledged or included; it seems as though a lot of things are happening without my knowledge, and the suggestions of others are being prioritized over mine, even when we have the same idea.",
Team always wants to get together last minute even though I advise otherwise.  I have to get all the written stuff done.  Eugene and Robbie help with the building of the hovercraft but it&#39;s super last minute.  Dia tries to help but she doesn&#39;t really get things done since she asks when all the paperwork is done and she doesn&#39;t really help with building any of the hovercraft.,
Megan is no longer in our team. ,
"I like the people in my group, and I think they like me back. It&#39;s a shame that Megan switched majors, she was really nice and funny.",
Team is fine. Nothing extraordinary but still pretty useful and people contribute a decent amount.,
"I like my team, but one of them gets their eyebrows done and thats kinda weird. ",
Everyone in the teams contributes and works wonderful together except Nelson. He is constantly putting his Frat activities before group meetings and rarely participates. He also has a very hard time excepting other classmates ideas or opinions. Other then that i believe we have a solid team.,
"While I do enjoy working with my fellow teammates, there can be at times some communication problems between us. Communication is indeed key when working with a team and our communication between us is only at a minor. While we do listen and hear each other out, I only hope that minor problem between our communication does not escalate to a major problem between us. Other than that, our team work is fine for now.",
"I am satisfied with the current group I have right now. Everyone has been doing their equal shares, everyone gets along, and planning goes smoothly.",
"Very happy with the group, everyone contributes and meets on time",
I wish we had more members to our group because logan has never participated. I feel like I am constantly getting the team on task and would like better communication skills. ,
"Logan has not been participating in our team. He hasn&#39;t shown up at all, hasn&#39;t done anything, and hasn&#39;t helped with the steps for the project. ",
"I think our team needs to work more on communication. We barely talk to each other. Every time we meet there is this awkward silence in the air.
Sometimes I find it really hard to set up team meetings where everyone will show up. One of our members hardly replies in the group chat, which is sort of a problem since the group chat is our only form of communication outside of class.
That&#39;s it for my complaints. ",
"I find that it is difficult to find time for all of us to meet up at the same time for meetings. However, I am glad to have a group that communicates well with each other and has different strengths/skills. Otherwise all is going well. ",
With two weeks into completing the project we have found ways to get around each others schedule and not get down on one each other because we have different ideas or direction we want to go. If one teammate can&#39;t make a meeting we don&#39;t begin to exclude them given they informed us as a whole. ,
I love my group they&#39;re all so nice and we all get along so well!,
My group is awesome. Everyone is excited and willing to work on our project! I am so grateful to CATME for magically pairing me with my group members. ,
My team gets along pretty well and everyone makes a pretty equal contribution. ,
The team has been great so far only complaint is sometimes team members are late to conferences.,
"MY team seems to be very active in our desires for this semester, but were having trouble finding meeting together outside of class. Also Savannah and Allison are both extremely valuable members whereas myself and TJ are kind of following behind as best as we can. I am trying to get more involved in activities, but I am the only one with a job to juggle at the same time as school. All teammates are extremely cooperative and friendly. If we can get together more often than class we will be an effective team.",
"No complaints at time of completing the survey, and no expected complaints in the future.",
"The Team works well together when we are available to work together, since we have 5 people it is difficult to find a time where we can all be there working together however when we are able to all meet we get a lot of work done.",
"My team and I get along socially and during work, we have a good dynamic.",
I am very happy with my teammates and don&#39;t expect any problems in the future.,
We have been a great team since our first meeting. We have no issues communicating and throwing ideas around to come up with a final decision. It makes it that much easier that we can joke around about anything and everything while we are working to make it that much more enjoyable.,
"My team is great, was a little worried at first but worked out well. ",
"Ethan has been sick for a while, but group is otherwise productive and cooperative.",
My team works well together but sometimes we have a hard time meeting up because our free time is limited.,
Everything is running smooth for the most part at this point. ,
"Team is working real well together, however we did procrastinate a little but that was all our faults and won&#39;t happen again.",
"I don&#39;t much like Megan, she states things that I find obtusely obvious and doesn&#39;t seem to realize just how frustrating the obvious statements are. She&#39;s a hard worker but I cant help but find myself slightly annoyed with her. It wont affect the teamwork though, I&#39;ll keep it professional.",
Groups works well together. And it should be a good semester.,
"The team is good, but Justin Howell has a lack of commitment. Fails to show up to labs and lectures.",
Justin does very little work and is rarely available even though catme says he is available. ,
"One of the members of our team, Mit, doesn&#39;t hear out our ideas and talks down to Jesse, Alberto, and I as if she&#39;s better than us. She acts as though she is the one who is right and we must completely agree with her or else we are wrong. More than once she has made us feel like terrible teammates for not being available to meet or for not understanding what she is saying. She constantly talks about how her teammates last year were misogynistic and how she was always right but they never listened to her so they failed the project.  ",
"Despite working very hard and being an extremely punctual and efficient worker, Ms. Aspittle is extremely hard to work with. I feel there is a large amount of unneeded stress placed upon me and my team members by her, which makes it very hard to get things done. She does not seem to know how to interact with people well, and is very rude most of the time; sometimes to the point of argument. I understand that this maybe due to other stress or work going on in her current life; but, truthfully speaking, she is so uptight about everything that I have considered leaving the class on multiple occasions. I have done and will continue to do my best to tolerate her attitude and finish this project, but as of right now, her display of an attitude is interfering with my willingness and ability to effectively do so. Alberto and Gabby have been extremely helpful in this project, and I can trust them to assist me in getting things done effectively.",
"My group mates are fine, but between the 4 of us, there is only the newly available lecture time when we are all free. Before that, there were no times when all 4 of us were free to work, which made making efficient progress very difficult. ",
"Its just the teams responsibility and own personal issues, I personally feel like I have to babysit everyone and make sure stuff is getting done on time when I&#39;m not the team leader anyway.",
"I am lucky to be part of such a great team. Everyone is enthusiastic and committed to delivering a successful project. So far, I have no complaints with any of my teammates. ",
"Our team has not run into any issues within the team to my knowledge. So far, we seem to be somewhat civil and on the same page with most matters. ",
I think we all work well together and everyone plays a part.,
"So far, we have worked well as a group. There have only been minor issues with regards to communication and punctuality to group meetings. Aside from that, when we are working together we work well and respect each other&#39;s opinions.",
CATME only works for availability times not necessarily the different and diverse skills brought into one group,
"I&#39;m a little worried about the communication among my team. So far it&#39;s going all right, but the past, going on, 2 weeks has been pretty vague excluding talking in person in the lectures.",
"My teammates Deev and Josh are active participants in the project and I enjoy working with them. They stay on task and are present, sometimes early to team meetings. Matthew is a stray ball on these parts however. Sometimes he will go to meetings early, sometimes he will be late. He has missed the first checkpoint and latest lecture so far, but has been present to team meetings. He generally isn&#39;t on task when our team meetings are going on and we are all working together. He does participate on occasions by collaborating with Josh on how the design will work and pan out, but does not contribute much to the work going in that my other two teammates show. It is early in to the project work and I hope that he will be able to show more effort as the semester progresses.",
I think that my team is great. We have no problem staying on task and doing everything in a timely fashion.,
I am readily enjoying my team and we work well together.,
"I feel like I do all that I can to help my group and I do the best of my abilities with each thing I am tasked with in this group. I do not have the understanding or passion for the material that other members of my group have, but I feel that I have taken initiative to do the things that I do know how to do, so that they are not hindered by my knowledge or lack thereof. ",
"My team is a great team and highly motivated. While we did have a hiccup in communication due to a broken phone, we still did our best to work together and gain a good understanding of what our project is and how to best approach it.",
NA,
None.,
"At the beginning of the project David Rund was taking on a lot of work that wasn&#39;t asked of him, and redoing work others had already done his own way. For checkpoint 1 he actually completely ditched all the calculations done by myself (after personally babysitting me through the calculations) and we ended up getting set back because of it. However, we as a team discussed with him, and he totally stopped and is now sharing the workload evenly, and allowing others to give their input. It looked a little grim at first, but we worked it out as a team. Jezra and Drew are both awesome teammates and I enjoy working with them, as well as with David now that he has relinquished the reins a little.",
"Some team members contribute more than others, but all do what is asked of them.  Design is a creative process wherein progress is made in fits and starts rather than linearly with time spent.  I therefore don&#39;t think its sensible to criticize other members for only doing what&#39;s asked of them, especially given that we&#39;re all freshmen and don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing.",
I have no comments I like my team.,
Kaylee is doing amazing and doing a great job at being lead.,
"I was not satisfied to be working on this team based on the last few weeks, because the last major assignment we did, the work was not fairly distributed. However, for the next upcoming assignments, the work has been fairly divided up among all team members.
",
"I feel like we make an effective team, but sometimes get side tracked in over thinking design ideas. Overall a great group.",
I feel good about this team.,
I enjoy this team. ,
Thanks,
Every team member is strong in separate fields. Working effectively together is tough sometimes but I try my best to compensate.,

"Hello, my team and I are doing good as far as completing work. But as far as communication and teamwork we do need work in that area. I would prefer not to say names but a team member is causing difficulty because he/she feels they could do the project on their own even though it is a team effort. He/she does not know how to take ideas into consideration until someone they feel is superior to them suggest something. This is the only concern i have and we are working hard to resolve the situation and to work together. Thank you. ",
We all seem to have our own areas of interest of which we do our best.,
Everyone on the team shows a desire to successfully complete the project. I don&rsquo;t think we will have any problems if we all work together.,
None,
"I am very quiet and haven&#39;t been the best at communicating with my team, but I will try to improve going forward. I will also try to increase my overall contribution and do a better share of the hands on work with building the actual hovercraft. ",
The Short Circuits is a great time,
All is good at this time.,
"Roedwilm Zach Princer lacks motivation and drive, he has consistently missed lectures and meetings, and when he does show up he sits on his phone with his headphones in and barely participates. He hasn&#39;t contributed to the team effort at all so far.",
My team is great ,
Everything is great thanks,
"we can&#39;t share that much time together, because everybody has different schedule. we are trying to work it out",
"Really glad my team is productive, cooperative, and supportive.",
"I was blessed with a team that works together. A team that works together, makes the dream work. So far, we all show great efforts toward making this project possible. ",
"The hard part about my team is that no one replies to the group messages, so I end up calling people individually to get in contact with them. I do not want to come across as bossy, but I need them to respond to the group messages during the day. If they are in another class, okay, but afterwards it would be nice to know that they acknowledge what I or someone says in the group. ",
"These guys are great, no complaints",
I am glad to be put on this team,
One of my teammates is not on the CATME list or when I completed this survey. This teammate also has not shown up to every team meeting but has completed his share of work when he is there.,
"Overall I can&#39;t really complain too much about the team I was put together with.  It&#39;s just difficult to get quality work done when some teammates don&#39;t show up to meetings, or when they don&#39;t contribute to the conversation very much.  It just makes it difficult on me when I try to push conversations about the hovercraft along and get the team to make progress towards a goal.  It can feel like trying to push a boulder up a hill at times.",
I am satisfied. ,
I have made friends with everyone in my group and believe that they are great individuals who I will keep in contact with for the rest of my college career.,
Great Team!!!,
"We have been meeting regularly and often, everyone present and cooperative so far.  If there is one thing we need to work on, it would be clear communication as a group.  We are improving that by communicating through GroupMe.",
"Thank you very much for putting me on this team. The team and I get along really well, and we are always on task. We are very organized and have everything planned out so that we can accomplish our tasks on time. Our team is determined to meet our goals and overcome any hardships along the way.",
Everyone on this team works very well together and all ideas that we come up with are explored well. However Thomas has been missing at some of our meetings when we needed him but other than this the team is very strong I think.,
"We sometimes have a issue figuring out a a meeting schedule, but we always find one and get our stuff done on time.",
"We have a good, everyone is involved in the team work. Nevertheless, we have some difficulties to meet because of my tennis tournaments or practices (M&eacute;lissa Huchet) and the job of others during the weekend. ",
"Sometimes it&#39;s hard for our team to meet up, but I feel like our team works really well together.",
Lovely group.,
"I think some of them need to maybe focus more on the assignments and start them earlier than a few days (like 1 or 2) in order for each of us to not feel rushed and feel confident with our ideas. Usually, when none of them start the assignments I would have to and end up doing 4/5 all of it. They then don&#39;t check over the answers of others or ask for help if they believe their answers are wrong. I wish they would put a little more effort into this than putting it all on me. I do still like my group though.",

"I like my group, we have no problems and everyone helps each other ",
One of my teammates has not shown up to work on the project. Jan does not respond to the group texts. ,
"One of our members, Jan, has not responded to any texts from our group nor has he showed up to any team meetings and has not contributed to anything in the project so far. ",
"One of our team member is still absence ever since the first lecture and skills lab where the teams get to meet each other for the first time (9/20 &amp; 9/21). We attempted to contact him, but there were no responses from him ever since.",
The only issue I have currently with my team is the communication. We all have very different schedules and most of us are busy. It is hard to find a time to meet and none of us seem to communicate about it very well. ,
I am very happy with this team. ,
Great team,
"I think that our group gets along very well and does good work together. I have yet to have an incident where anyone is shut down or excluded from the group activities. So far our team has had equal share of all the work we do and we are together as much as our schedules will permit. We have done a lot of work and had a few setbacks, but continue to work on the hovercraft as expected. We have completed everything on time and have put in extra work when we run into problems in order to resolve them. In all, I think that we have an excellent team dynamic and very functional team members. ",
I enjoy my team and we seem to do even amounts of work. ,
This is one of the best groups I have been in. I like how everyone is respectful and blissfully aware of what needs to be done in order to maintain the project and complete the tasks at hand. My teammates are encouraging and willing to help in areas that other members may not have the desired strengths in.,
I have a good team.,
Looking forward to completing this course with my team and then moving on to working with other teams in the Engineering Dept.,
N/a,
"I enjoy my team members as people, however we have very conflicting schedules and have a very difficult time communicating. Myles has contributed very little to the project thus far and is rarely present for lectures and skills lab. We do work well together and I believe it will get better, but we need to make more of an effort to actually meet up and work on assignments in our free time. ",
"The team is alright, we need to work on meeting up and engaging together more.",
I have been put in a good team and I can&#39;t wait to see our growth from now till the end of the semester.,
Overall I am satisfied with my team and have no complaints.,
Its a little early to tell how our team works together but for the most part we get along well and are comfortably able to share our ideas. The most difficult part is committing to a choice.,
I hsve no comments,
Great so far!,
"I am very pleased with my team. At first I was concerned about having to work in a unit but my team mates have completely alleviated that fear with their upbeat attitudes, encouraging attitudes, and technical contributions to the team.",
I like the group I&rsquo;m in. We work well together ,
"We have a good team. There are no problems with our group at present.
",
My teammates have been working very well together. When someone isn&#39;t able to make it as much because of other events the others pick up the slack and make sure that everything gets done on time. ,
Marco goes above and beyond and is always willing to work on whatever needs to get done. Jared is helpful but his job makes him less available but he does specify when he can and cant come to meetings. Jokob is a good worker but is a little flaky.,
"It seems CATME did not do a great job creating groups with maximum available common times. It is often difficult to find a couple open hours for our group to meet. Overall, though, things have worked out. ",
"Adolfo is the only one of us that has work so sometimes he can&#39;t come to meetings, but he still does a lot of work and participates in the meetings he does come to. Both Marissa and Jesse do an equal amount of a lot of work and always come to the meetings. I do a lot of work as well, but sometimes if those two are on a roll there is no room for me to add in some work. We have only had one checkpoint however, so there might be some shifting in the work next time. Overall, we all get along very well and I am pleased with the group I am in. ",
They&#39;re all fine and have been doing their work diligently. I wish some would try to be slightly more outspoken since they seem slightly reserved. Other than that everyone is competent and working together. ,
"I like this team quite a bit. I definitely work better with some in the group as opposed to others. However, I understand that is the nature of a team dynamic, personality preferences play a large part. Personality preferences aside, I am actively working on finding better ways to communicate with Jason and articulate my need for him to stay on task and not make up unnecessary work for himself on group time. Things are good right now.",
I thoroughly enjoy my team and the strong work ethic that we have.,
"Jennifer and I work insanely well together and with one other person to do grunt work we could do it perfectly on our own. Jason has communication issues, likes to argue and hates being wrong. Peyton is quiet and does not do as much work but it may be just because we don&#39;t give him enough to do because he does not take on responsibility on his own. Scott is really busy outside of class and therefore doesn&#39;t have the same amount of time to spend on the project. But because of Jennifer I can make a functional hovercraft without going insane.",
"Everyone, including myself could do better in communication and (other priorities permitting) getting our share of the work done more quickly.",
No comments,
My team is great!,
"Could not have asked the computer to pick any better of a team for me. Very pleased that I got put on a team that works together and does not have any problems, along with a diverse range of skills.",

My group members are very decent.,
"My team is cool, respectable and easy to work with.",
I believe that each team member is contributing 100% effort and wants to succeed. ,

Good and hardworking team. ,
Although it is hard for Fernando to make team meetings because he does live off campus he could put in more effort towards the team.,
Everyone works hard and does their share in the project ,
"Regarding the interaction my teammates have with one another, I find that Fernando is often quite and seems to conform to what everyone else suggests. ",
Fernando is a good helper but he lives off campus making it hard to meet sometimes not being able to put in the full credit.,
"We have issues with getting everything done ahead of time on a schedule. Even though we don&#39;t get things done ahead of time, we haven&#39;t had any issues completing everything needed by due dates. I need to step up more as a team leader to keep us all on track.",
I&#39;m very glad I get to work with such a good group of guys.,
"I think that its going to be going better because everyone is going to start showing up. I think that in the group the important members are Josh, Joel and I. Zahidul and Aaron don&#39;t seem as interactive and it feels like they are &quot;along for the ride&quot; but mostly Zahidul is like that.",
"There is a slight issue with 2 members of the current team. Zahid is easily distracted and seems like some one who is willing to put in as little effort as possible, and pass the course. Aaron has missed a few meetings and has not contributed much as of yet, but he understands where he is at with the team. Has spoken to us about attempting to put more effort in during the upcoming weeks.
Josh has stepped up as someone who will take care of note taking and put a major responsibility upon himself in taking care of the team journal. Dana has also stepped up as he volunteered to take care of finances, and material safe keeping. They are both willing to put in extra time for the project if need be.",
All my teammates are dope. Everybody does their required task and they&#39;re all good at it.,
No complaints here just might not have enough money to pay for anymore,
I feel our team has worked great together in completing assignments both inside and outside the classroom.,
"My team works well together, however, there are some issues that need to be address. First of all,the main issue is that Smit never shows up to lecture. He didn&rsquo;t show up for both lectures this week. This makes it hard to communicate and unfair to the other people on my team. Smit also doesn&rsquo;t communicate on the group chat as much as other teammates so the overall communication with Smit is little to none. The second and final issue would be to meet up more outside of class. While this is a difficult thing to achieve with everyone&rsquo;s busy lives, it would help the process of this semester long project go more smoothly.",
"Everything is going well thus far, however I wish Edgar would participate more as I think his ideas would be very helpful to the group. ",
"My only concern is how different are schedules are, other than that, we all have good chemistry. ",
"JB has gone above and beyond what he has had to do, basically taking our entire project onto his shoulders. He definitely deserves most of the credit at this point.Edgar and I are doing what needs to be done but honestly nothing more than is necessary. Juan does the same but he is a bit harder to work with due to the fact that he always needs to put his opinion into the mix even if it is very wrong. Things will probably work out just fine but this is what is going on at this time.",
NA,
As a team we are working well together and meeting deadlines. This team males the class an enjoyable process.,
N/A,
"I am adjusting to an environment where there is not a lot of differentiation in status of position; meaning that when the team leader sets out tasks it is merely a student asking another student to complete something. It doesn&#39;t seem to reflect a boss asking a worker to complete a task, an in effect time lines/communications/follow-through are individual dependent. I&#39;m having preliminary concerns about the line of communication of our group. I have to remember that these are students and priorities are different from a professional setting. But I have talked to a few people about the best way to inspire these actions, and will try and incorporate them into the group.",
My team is the best.,
"I try to help my team to the best of my ability, but to be honest, I always feel like they&#39;re doing all the complicated and difficult tasks. Yes, all four of us agreed that I&#39;d put myself in charge of keeping our kit together and making sure the things they order online for our hovercraft get here, but that&#39;s all. Aside from that and the lifting fan calculator I set up, I feel like I&#39;m honestly just not contributing enough, especially at team meetings.",
"All in all, my team is great. I&#39;m actually the weakest link given my work schedule and relative unavailability, but we&#39;ve worked it all out.",
All three of my partners live off campus and two have jobs so having a meeting that isn&#39;t planned at least a week in advance will be difficult.,
With all the stories I have heard about Engineering 100 and how your team makes or breaks you experience I am very happy with my team thus far ,
"With this team, even though I keep reminding my teammates to do their part, I feel that they won&#39;t do their part unless I get involved, or they will do it hours before it is due. From what I have seen so far, I can&#39;t really trust to leave them to do certain parts because I feel like they just don&#39;t prioritize this project.",
I enjoy the people in my team but I sometimes worry that we won&#39;t get things done before the deadline.,
Caleb has not contributed anything so far due to schedule conflicts but he&#39;s promised to make up for it.,
I was out of town without a lot of access to WiFi for an entire week and they were very flexible about it and understanding.,
I love the way my teem works with each other and communicates with each other!,
"I don&#39;t really know how to feel about my team anymore. It&#39;s hard to really get stuff done because we&#39;re all confused and no one but me does anything about it. I feel like I am the brains of this team and everyone is holding me back, but I&#39;m not quite ready to say that I want to switch groups.",
Team 97is da best,
"I don&#39;t think I could have gotten a better team. I&#39;m just afraid that I won&#39;t keep up. Other than that, my teammates are incredible guys and smart intellectuals.",
Is it my job as a team leader to take all of their information and put it all into the document?,
"I believe my team and I match up very well, we all have similar styles of learning and working, everything works out perfectly, I couldn&#39;t be happier. ",
"My team is great! We all get along very well and always bounce ideas off each other, resulting in success when overcoming obstacles. I am extremely pleased with my group!",
"I&#39;m really happy with my team. I feel like we all contribute equally and we all get along well, while still making good progress on our work.",
No comments at this time,
My teammates seemed to have been born knowing how to do almost everything asked of this class where as I feel I must sit down and learn it thorough and because of this I feel left out and not capable. I was also left out for our first meeting due to my teammates not contributing me in the work. they are friends and live in the same dorm so it made it easy for them to push everything off and do al the work last minute when it seemed easy. They had emailed me at 9:06pm letting me know they want to meet at 9:00pm on that day. We have figured out communication since then. I do NOT live on campus.,
Things are going pretty well in my opinion. We just need to get a little bit better at communicating when we will all get together and work on tasks. ,
"Me, Skyler, and Elliot do most of the work. Jason is always late to the skills lab and doesn&#39;t contribute as much. We&#39;ve given him tasks to do so hopefully we&#39;re able to get him more involved ",
Good team! Don&#39;t like the course material however or the TA work has a lot to be desired.,
Good team. 10/10 would build hovercraft again.,
The workload is often a little unbalanced and quality expectations are different for some than others but overall the group functions fine.,
"No additional comments, group works very well together.",
"I swear these answers are my actual opinion, I was not coerced in any way, shape, or form",
This team meshes well together and we are productive when we come together to work.,
The team is good and moral is high. ,
No additional comments needed. Team works well and is respectful.,
everything is working great.,
"All my team members contribute an equal amount and we all get along really well. Emily is a very outgoing spirit who always keeps the energy high and contributes a great deal of work to the team. Taylor also holds a strong presence on our team, taking care of a lot of budget management and completing journals. Josh is skilled all round and contributes a fair amount to every aspect of the project.",
"I like my team. They&#39;ve all been very flexible with meeting up. We were able to get together six times before checkpoint 1, which I thought was awesome.",
"I feel like I stress a lot, especially when it comes to team projects. I really hope that it does not affect my team negatively. I also feel like I am the only one who is really keeping up on deadlines and scheduling meetings which I don&#39;t like because I feel like it puts a lot of pressure on me. I am going to try to talk to them about it though. ",
"I would like to start by saying that my team is functions great with the exception of one member. This is Joshua Webb. Joshua Webb seems completely disinterested in the project, as on multiple occasions we have caught him trying to watch baseball instead of contributing to meetings even after we told him that he needed to contribute. Joshua Webb very rarely tries to contribute to the meetings in general unless prompted to, even then, his insights are rarely helpful. When it comes to him helping out on the assignments, there is very little he can do to assist because of the fact that he doesn&#39;t understand the coursework. For instance, the only thing we could assign for him to do on the Design Concept Report is to draw the hovercraft with help from other group members. This causes the project to be harder than just having 3 group members because we have to find a way to involve Joshua in all parts of the project. This slows us down and makes the project than it needs to be.",
"Mason, Everett, and I work together very well. We all give our 110% effort especially when we are together. However, Joshua does not participate without major coaxing, Everett is usually the one who does this. During our team meetings so far, Joshua has either contributed nothing, taken time away from the group as we try to make him participate which ends with a comment along the lines of &quot;yeah, I like that idea.&quot; comments such as those are what he contributes after the three of us already decide something such as propulsion technique. Professor Vollstedt even had to ask him to close his laptop in the middle of our meeting with her during checkpoint 1. These are just an idea of what Joshua does that demonstrates to us that he will no help our group. ",
"Still feels early to give a true assessment, will learn more as year progresses. Currently, team is working together fine.",
We work well together.,
Our team works well together,
These boys do their best and that&#39;s all that can be asked of them. I have fun working with them and am excited to continue working with them! ,
This team works well together and has members that all show traits of good teammates.,
I&#39;m lucky to have a chill team that does work evenly :),
"Nothing to really comment on this first checkpoint, for the most part my team has been working pretty well and we&#39;re working pretty well together. I did do most of the work this checkpoint, but this was honestly my own doing as there was not really an opportunity for everyone to put in a large amount of work. Ben was also a lot of help, helping me look up the batteries and do the battery calculation. Everyone put their two cents into the design process for checkpoint 1.",
.,
"I&#39;m satisfied with my team, I&#39;ve had a lot of group work in college so far and they are definitely on the better end of the spectrum in my experiences. While we do encounter many problems with the project itself, none of the issues stem from a personality conflict or general lack of interest in the project. We are all definitely on the same page as of right now and are on track to complete the project early. Thank you for giving us a platform to give feedback. ",
The team is great.,
"The team is great, everyone gets along well and gets their assignments completed on time",
"I&#39;m feeling good about my team and our work ethic. Expect great things!
",
"You&#39;re doing a great job, you know that?",
esketit,
"I don&#39;t think any of them want to kill me, so that&#39;s a plus",
"I believe that every member of my team makes key contributions. We work on everything together to make sure no one is stuck with a huge workload, although some times people finish the last bits of an assignment on their own after our team meetings. I believe everyone gives equal effort and we all do quality work. I am satisfied with my team and I believe we&#39;re going to make an excellent hovercraft.",
"I feel like my team is very diverse, and we get along with one another really well. ",
"It&#39;s been great working with these guys. The only problem is that we as a team are not great at planning meetings, as it seems that things come up out of the blue. Despite this, we&#39;re able to get things done without it seeming like one person is doing more work than another.",
Everything is going great!,
"I feel like it is too early to say if we will have any problems in the team. If there are any now I am unaware of them, however I think the team and I are more than capable of fixing any problem we run into. Overall, the past few weeks have gone by smoothly and I think we work well together.",
"Slightly worried about how low priority it is for people until they HAVE to work on it. Alex and Joshua have had some scheduling conflicts; Alex in particular has missed 2 meetings. These conflicts were clearly communicated and there has been time arranged for them to meet and work on the project, but if they don&#39;t get enough done during the make up time, and if this is happening for a lot of meetings, there could be an issue.",
"I feel like that while scheduling compatibility is important, the level of background knowledge should be a factor as well or at least how to deal with it. One of the members of the team has extensive background experience and focuses too much on his ideas being more correct since he knows the most. He doesn&#39;t really explain clearly how his previous knowledge of the subject works in a helpful way and I think this takes away from the learning aspect of the project.",
"Matthew and Eryl butted heads in the beginning, but they are starting to work together better now.",
"There&#39;s a lot of type A people in my group. As in 2, so there&#39;s tension sometimes. That&#39;s normal though.",
"It seems like my team will work great together, we will just have to see how we work when we are in a higher stress environment.",
"I think our team is working okay together. My main concern is, even though teams were meant to be paired by availability, our schedules do not seem to be very compatible. Hopefully we can figure out better times.",
"Everyone on team is willing to do work, open to suggestions and new ideas.",
"The team functions well.  My only complaint is that Michael Pence shows little trust/belief in ideas produced by team members and the assignment instructions.  It does not, however, get in the way of progress.",
"For the most part, I am okay with the team. It could be a lot worse, but there are still some personality traits that rub me the wrong way, but I don&#39;t see this being a problem unless it gets worse.
Tyler and Connor will often answer my &quot;basic&quot; questions with sarcastic answers. I realize that to them, it&#39;s obvious, and so deserves a sarcastic answer, but several times now, I&#39;ve asked a genuine question, and have had to either drop the question entirely, or ask a ta.
Tyler also sometimes makes snide comments about other teams or their members, specifically against Matt. This makes me mad because I&#39;m at least 85% sure he has some form of autism, and it feels like he&#39;s making fun of him for being different. It makes me not want to work with someone who can be rude like that.
In terms of work flow, we&#39;re fine, and I have no doubt we will complete the project easily. However, these interactions make the overall experience less enjoyable. Again, these won&#39;t entirely affect how much work we can do, but I definitely am not excited to work in the group. I don&#39;t dread going, but I&#39;m not excited for our meetings.",
I am pleased with my team and we work well together and get things done in a timely manner,
Our team is pretty great! Good contributions all around. Occasionally I accidentally interrupt others but I&#39;m working on improving that part of myself (I just get excited about the project),
"The team is well, everyone is doing their part.",
"The team is good, working out times to meet was definitely difficult because of our schedules at first, but now it&#39;s working out very well.",
"As a team, we could do better with time allocation and distribution of work. As a whole we a have a good understanding of each others skills and can be released to its full potential with time. I&#39;m not overjoyed with my teammembers or myself but I believe that we will get the job done.",
"I really enjoy the team that I was set up with, and couldn&#39;t really say anything poorly about them. Honestly, the only person that feels like they don&#39;t have consistent quality working in this team is myself. I&#39;ve been late to a meeting or two, and had to leave a couple sooner than I feel I should have. I have been trying to make up for that by working harder on the assignments I have been given. Regardless, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if my teammates rate me lower because of my group work ethic. Norman works great as a team leader, listening to ideas and problems that others bring up. The other two, Joe and Clint, while quiet during our meetings, help complete the work as well as grab materials from their different possible places. We ended off our last meetup by saying that we were really proud of the team that we got, and confident in our ability to finish our project. Cheers!",
"Aside from the few hiccups in the beginning, things look fine. Issues that were had have mostly been ironed out.
Have a swell afternoon!",
Other than the small issue wit CATME putting Nilan into our group even though he was in another lab. Our team is great,
"I love my team they are the best around, and nothing&#39;s ever gonna get us down!",
"good guys and all very helpful
",
"Ben is trying his best, and I get that. He just hasn&#39;t been contributing to the group as much as the rest of us have. I still want him on the team because he is experienced in programming and in electrical techniques and he will be a very useful teammate once he shows up to meetings on time",
I have a good team.,
My team is awesome!,
"I have nothing bad to say about my team!!!
yet...",
:),
My team and I work very well together as a group on every team assignment. I am very pleased with my group so far. ,
"Although Ben is an active team mate he makes it impossible to work with him. When other team members have ideas, his ideas are the ones he likes and goes for the most. It is like trying to work with a brick wall. Not to say he doesn&#39;t do anything, he does a lot. But he is forced to do a lot or nothing by the way he acts.
Nate is a stand up guy. I like his attitude and wished I had two more of him on my team. Always ready and on time with ideas.
Bryson, I don&#39;t know much about him. A quite person who is smart. I wanted to use a really dumb design for propulsion and he came up with a simple and easy method. I am honored to have such a person on my team.
Amir, although I am biased against myself i will try to tell it as it is. I have very neat and nice hand writing and tend to make an extra sheet of notes &amp; work sheets. So my work is usually used. I have tried to help out in the group as much as possible but ben is not making it easy for me. His personality is like that of a baby crow, one that only a mother can love. I feel like I have put a lot of effort into the group only for him to stifle it. I have a great dislike for field manuals and things resembling them. Ben is a walking field manual. I think ben is a nice guy, and i look forward for the challenges ahead. For the best way for me to learn to work with people like ben is in school. I am a believer in learning by doing, and I have helped out my team by leading them into uncharted territories by researching what we are doing before hand and trying to tap dance my way with them. Ben being the walking field manual though insist we do it the &quot;correct way&quot;. Although i see the merit behind this, I don&#39;t like to be coddled by TA&#39;s if i can help it.
From,
Amir Fahraji",
"I believe that our team has good chemistry, gets along well and will do just fine for the duration of this particular project.",
So far our team has been able to work very well together. ,
"Good group, excited to see our final product!",
"I really love this team, the know how to work together with me and always show interest into our assignment and reaching our due dates. ",
Jackson Pickard dropped the class. So disregard everything about him please.,
Still breaking the ice between us since we are all fairly quiet and come from very different backgrounds and experiences.,
"This team is good at meeting deadlines and doing the steps correctly, I just feel like we wait until the last minute to get things done, even though I prefer to get work done in a timely manner, and not procrastinate quite as much. However, everyone on the team does contribute pretty equally when we are in the meetings. ",
"Yinkai and the team have a language barrier considering he is learning still learning english.First week of teams he never showed or got in touch, but finally showed and introduced himself after we completed checkpoint 1. Helps with what he can but has only showed up to one lab since teams were create, and that was reviewing our checkpoint 1. Absent for soldering. He&#39;s a good kid, just hard to work with.
Jared is very unproductive. He complains on a regular basis, and loudly to where i had to apologize to the people sitting in front of us in Lab today. Talks very negatively about everything, and does not participate. He asks every lab if he can just do nothing. During soldering lab he played minecraft on his laptop the whole class period. He has fixed one equation on our checkpoint 1, and that is all he has done so far.
Cyrus is one of the only people actually helping get this project done. He gets along well with everyone and stays focused on his work, and continues to explain and confusing parts to the team. I feel it is only Cyrus and I who have been working on this project and I highly appreciate him for his patience and understanding.
I would love to continue to keep working with Cyrus as we are good friends now, but the other two teammates I am not sure what to do with.
- Juliette Bullock, section 1209, team 145",
"In the group, it feels like Juliette and I are the only ones ever working, and we have to reel in Jared most of the time to participate and come to team meetings. Juliette is the perfect example of a teammate, who wants everyone working and does everything within her power to ensure we meet deadlines and get everything done. When Jared is helping, he provides quality work that we can use, but the problem we are having as a group is that he often strays off and does other things and would rather not help us out.
Yinkai has been absent and completely for most class periods and team meetings, making it hard for us to split the work as well as the payments between 3 people instead of the additional 4. He has only attended one of our team meetings, and he slipped away elsewhere for the majority of it. As a team, we arent sure what to do with Yinkai. ",
Team is doing good. No problems at all.,
Was worried about not having a motivated team but this group has been fantastic so far. ,
"Honestly, I have worked on a lot of team based exercises in my time and this team is well formatted and works together nicely. The group does not bicker and is able to form comprehensive solutions to problems. I have be given the role of team leader and I feel as though the team is able to listen and respond well when it is necessary for me to assign tasks. Overall the group is well balanced and formatted ",
The biggest struggle of our group is people not putting their ideas on the table to be evaluated. Both zac and matthew are very reserved in their opinions and contributions. They must be asked to do something (such as look for parts)  instead of taking initiative to do it knowing that it needs to be done when they have the information. ,
"No comment
",
"This team is good. I like this team a lot. We can work together when the time arises. Jonah and Gary work well alone, but this past checkpoint we really had complications. We did get through it, but if we don&#39;t start working together, it&#39;s going to get worse.",
"our group is spread between really laid back individual (Jonah), another is too straightforward, which isn&#39;t bad (Gary), one who doesn&#39;t really know what to do and is willing to do anything that he can work with (Giovanni). I feel like I end up in between both Jonah, and Gary, sometimes it is hard when one tries to tell everyone that there is time and we don&#39;t need to get things done right now, (Jonah), and Gary gets overstressed and needs to get things done when things mess up and doesn&#39;t listen to anyone when that happens, it&#39;s hard to work when that happens.",
"The team works together fine, everyone tries to contribute, work is inefficient though and coordinating schedules is difficult.",
"We have some trouble starting when we need to figure something out, but we always end up working together and figuring it out.",
"For the most part, I am satisfied with the team I have.",
"I am really happy that I was assigned to this group. Everyone treats each other with respect, we have fun, and we complete all of our assignments. I can&#39;t wait to see what else this semester will bring to my team and I!",
Everyone is doing great so far!,
"The Team is okay. Deadlines get met almost at last minute which kind of worries me, but work gets done and turned in on time. Buying things for the Hovercraft has been sloppy and unorganized.",
"I&#39;ve done most of the work so far. I&#39;m not really sure how to split it up in the first place. Nicholas offers to help, but I can&#39;t help him while doing things on my own. Seth and Omar don&#39;t really volunteer to help. They are nice guys but haven&#39;t been super helpful.
Tips on how to split up work is appreciated maybe? Or just how to trust the other members of the team to do their work - I have trust issues when it comes to school work.",
"Joshua Garcia is no longer in the course, so our team his dwindled down to 3.",
My team all do their fair share of work and participate equally,
I believe our team is working well together. ,
"I feel that my teammates are all mature, and this makes completing the project easier for all of us. I can trust them to do the work, and they can also trust me. ",
Everyone is working well and getting along great. We are having a blast and getting lots of work done.,
None at this time.,
"Although this doesn&#39;t apply to checkpoint 1, I am beyond frustration of the work ethics of my group members. I would not deny I was the type of person who would procrastinate to the very last minute in high school, but there are limits to that. As long as you have a plan to get it done on time, I am fine with it, but you must let your team know. Our hovercraft parts were not ordered by the end of the week of checkpoint 1, it was ordered near the end of the following week. Despite constant reminders and just straight up telling, some people just couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t order the parts. I had to just create an account on amazon just so I can order some of the parts for express shipping. Communication is lacking too, define answers are never provided unless I demand them. I have to bend my back just to achieve our goals. I know I said this was fine previous to team selection, but when people take it for granted is another situation.",
My team is easy to work with.,
"Grace and Sylvia have come up short, but they are going to be our builders, so ratings will be better. 157 is the best team :)",
"At times, communication in the group tends to be lacking. Some diverge from the matter at hand and work in seclusion as opposed to working as part of the team. This makes the others confused as to what has been done and what needs to be done. ",
"We have several issues with communication within our team. Our checkpoint 2 grade will be affected because of it. When a question is asked in the GroupMe team chat, it is often not responded to by several members of the group (usually 3/5 don&#39;t respond). This is harmful because many of the recent questions have been about scheduling meeting times and which products should be purchased for our project. The lack of communication caused our fan purchase to be too late for checkpoint 2 and caused only 1 battery pack out of two needed to be ordered. After, a member of the team blamed the member in charge of purchasing the fans for communicating poorly when in fact both were at fault. I am not sure what to do to improve our communication skills so that way we can be more successful in the future. I hope to speak to you during office hours on Wednesday to hopefully find ways to fix this issue.",
Thank You Giving me an Amazing Team.,
the team is alright and need more time to decide how I feel about everyone.  Eugene and Dia are fine and I like Robbie&#39;s personality but he gets easily distracted with Eugene plus Robbie has barely done anything but he claims he&#39;ll step it up.,
